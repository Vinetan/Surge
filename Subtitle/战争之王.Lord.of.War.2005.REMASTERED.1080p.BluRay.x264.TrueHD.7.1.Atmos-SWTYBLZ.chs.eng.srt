1
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,140
在这世界上
{\fs60}There are over 550 million firearms

2
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,810
全世界一共有5亿5千万支军火
{\fs60}in world-wide circulation.

3
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,660
那就是说每12个人中就有1只枪
{\fs60}That's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet.

4
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,780
唯一的问题是
{\fs60}The only question is...

5
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,610
我们如何让其他11个人也有枪
{\fs60}how do we arm the other eleven?

6
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,010
{\bord0\shad4\fad(400,200)\fs120\pos(942,725.2)}战争{\bord0\shad4\fs90} 之 {\r\bord0\shad4\fs120}王

7
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,470
你不用担心
{\fs60}You don't have to worry.

8
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,300
我不会说一堆谎话 让你觉得我是好人
{\fs60}I'm not gonna tell you a pack of lies to make me look good.

9
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,350
我只是告诉你到底发生什么事
{\fs60}I'm just gonna tell you what happened.

10
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,740
我的名字是尤里·奥洛夫
{\fs60}My name is Yuri Orlov.

11
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,810
我年幼时，我们全家来到了美国
{\fs60}When I was a boy, my family came to America.

12
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,780
但没有完全融入美国社会
{\fs60}But not all the way.

13
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,600
像其他乌克兰人一样 我们都聚集在布莱顿滩
{\fs60}Like most Ukrainians, we gathered in Brighton Beach.

14
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,910
这里可以让我们想起黑海
{\fs60}It reminded us of the Black Sea.

15
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,620
我很快地就意识到我们只是从一个地狱到了另外一个地狱
{\fs60}I soon realized we'd just swapped one hell for another.

16
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,190
即使在地狱里 天使有时也会出现
{\fs60}Even in hell, an angel sometimes makes an appearance.

17
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,400
我十岁时就崇拜艾娃·方田
{\fs60}I'd worshipped Ava Fontaine since I was 10 years old.

18
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,960
她当然不知道我的存在
{\fs60}Of course, she didn't know I existed.

19
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,680
有的时候我自己也这么觉得
{\fs60}I was starting to think she had a point.

20
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,580
在我生命的前二十几年里
{\fs60}For the first twenty-odd years of my life...

21
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,590
小奥德萨对我来说 就像对这列火车一样
{\fs60}...Little Odessa was to me what it is to the Q train...

22
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,830
是终点站
{\fs60}...the end of the line.

23
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,800
{\bord0\shad4\fad(400,300)\fs75\pos(1436,900.7)}小奥德萨           纽约         1982

24
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,460
哦，关于我的名字，我刚撒了个谎
{\fs60}Oh, I did lie about my name.

25
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,370
其实并不是尤里·奥洛夫
{\fs60}It's not really Yuri Orlov.

26
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,080
在20世纪的某些时候做个犹太人是有好处的
{\fs60}There've been few occasions in the in the 20th century when it's been an advantage be a Jew.

27
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,870
70年代我们全家为了逃离苏联
{\fs60}But in the 'seventies, to escape the Soviet Union,

28
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,860
就伪装成犹太人
{\fs60}our family pretended to be Jewish.

29
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,970
从此我就活得不怎么好
{\fs60}Little about my life has been kosher ever since

30
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,260
老哥，你好吗？
{\fs60}How's it going, brother?

31
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,700
不怎么样
{\fs60}It's not.

32
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,960
这是维塔利，我弟弟
{\fs60}That's Vitaly, my younger brother.

33
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,380
他和我一样，对生命感到迷惘
{\fs60}He was as lost as me.

34
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,720
只是他现在还不知道罢了
{\fs60}He didn't know it yet.

35
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,690
尤里 你迟到了
{\fs60}Yuri, you're late.

36
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,770
我父亲很快地就把 这伪装的身份当真了
{\fs60}My father took his assumed identity to heart.

37
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,220
他比很多犹太人更犹太
{\fs60}He was more Jewish than most Jews.

38
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,720
这使我信天主教的母亲很生气
{\fs60}Which drove my Catholic mother crazy.

39
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,980
说过多少次啦？
{\fs60}How many times?

40
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,470
我不能吃贝类
{\fs60}I can't eat shellfish.

41
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,350
不圣洁
{\fs60}It's treyf.

42
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,440
你不是犹太人
{\fs60}You're not Jewish.

43
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,470
但我喜欢这样
{\fs60}I like it.

44
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,120
我喜欢帽子
{\fs60}I like the hat.

45
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,000
时时提醒我们 上面有人类的主宰
{\fs60}To remind us there is something above us.

46
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,260
我喜欢那样想
{\fs60}I like that.

47
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,700
我要去(犹太)教堂
{\fs60}I'm going to temple.

48
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,500
别去！你比牧师去得还勤
{\fs60}You're not going to temple. You go to temple more than the rabbi.

49
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,330
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(952,895.3)}你这女人少管我的事

50
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,790
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(952,895.3)}老天！你什么时候才能清醒点儿？

51
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,870
尤里，别忘了去看一看皇宫酒店的特价
{\fs60}Yuri, don't forget to check the specials at the Palace.

52
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,440
在小奥德萨长大
{\fs60}Growing up in Little Odessa,

53
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,500
人杀人是家常便饭
{\fs60}murder was everyday part of life.

54
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,960
俄罗斯黑帮也从苏联移民到了这里
{\fs60}Russian mobsters had also migrated from the Soviet Union

55
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,910
而且他们来美国时
{\fs60}and when they came to America,

56
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,440
还带着家伙呢
{\fs60}their baggage came with them.

57
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,600
社区里 每天都有些帮派份子斗殴
{\fs60}There was always some gangster getting whacked in my neighborhood,

58
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,860
只是我从没亲眼见过
{\fs60}but I'd never seen it with my own eyes.

59
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,260
每次我总是早五分钟
{\fs60}I had this knack of showing up five minutes before something went down,

60
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,890
或晚五分钟
{\fs60}or five minutes after.

61
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,280
但那天不一样
{\fs60}Not that day.

62
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,900
这一枪打醒了我
{\fs60}It hit me.

63
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,070
就像是枪打在我身上一样震撼
{\fs60}It couldn't have hit me harder if I was the one who'd been shot.

64
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,460
你开饭馆
{\fs60}You go into the restaurant business...

65
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,960
是因为人总是要吃饭
{\fs60}because people are always going to have to eat.

66
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,460
那天我意识到我的命运是为了提供人们的另一种生活必需品
{\fs60}That was the day I realized my destiny lay in fulfilling another basic human need.

67
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,910
下个安息日，我和父亲一起去教堂
{\fs60}The next Sabbath, I went to temple with my father.

68
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,500
然而我并不是想要接近上帝
{\fs60}However, it wasn't God I was trying to get close to.

69
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,840
我的长子，尤里
{\fs60}Eli, my eldest son, Yuri.

70
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:02,180
在那儿我认识了第一把 以色列制的乌兹冲锋枪
{\fs60}My contact at synagogue landed me my first Israeli-made Uzi submachine guns.

71
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,980
第一次卖枪的感觉很大程度上就象第一次做爱一样
{\fs60}The first time you sell a gun is a lot like the first time you have sex.

72
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,700
你根本不知道自己在干嘛
{\fs60}You have absolutely no idea what you're doing.

73
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,870
虽然很刺激 但很快就结束了
{\fs60}But it is exciting and one way or another,it's over way too fast.

74
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,760
先生们
{\fs60}Gentlemen.

75
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,820
新型乌兹自动手枪
{\fs60}The new Uzi machine pistol.

76
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,620
体积虽小，但火力强大
{\fs60}Big firepower in a small package.

77
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,830
这宝贝用的是九毫米凹头子弹
{\fs60}This little baby uses 9 mm hollow points.

78
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,000
20或25发可扩充式弹夹
{\fs60}Twenty twenty-five round extendable mags...

79
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,620
枪柄大小可调
{\fs60}...rear-flip adjustable sights.

80
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,760
消音器是标准装备 后座力极低
{\fs60}Silencer comes standard. Excellent recoil reduction.

81
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,340
枪口上抬减少四成
{\fs60}Muzzle jump reduced forty percent.

82
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,210
噪音减少六成
{\fs60}Sixty percent improved noise suppression.

83
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,820
就算你“现在”朝我打完一整夹子弹
{\fs60}You could pump a mag into me right now

84
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,230
也不会吵醒隔壁的人
{\fs60}and never wake the guy in the next room.

85
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,030
当然这样你就没机会和我再做更大的生意了
{\fs60}Of course, that would eliminate your opportunity for repeat business.

86
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,180
我天生就有走私违禁品的才能
{\fs60}I did have a natural instinct for smuggling contraband.

87
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,280
幸运的是那时的摄像机有火箭筒那么大
{\fs60}Fortunately, back then a video camera was a big as a bazooka

88
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,040
我的一生都在远离暴力
{\fs60}Here I'd been running away from violence my whole life,

89
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,820
但其实我更该接近它才对
{\fs60} and I should've run towards it.

90
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,390
这是人类的天性
{\fs60}It's in our nature.

91
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:15,250
最初人类遗骸的肋骨腔中就有一个矛箭头
{\fs60}The earliest human skeletons had spearheads in their rib cages.

92
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,720
怎么搞这么久？
{\fs60}Where have you been?

93
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,480
如果客人来了怎么办？
{\fs60}What if we had a customer?

94
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,110
上帝保佑美国
{\fs60}God bless America.

95
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,850
“当心恶犬” 你哪儿来的狗！
{\fs60}Beware of the dog? You don't have a dog.

96
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,900
想吓人呀？
{\fs60}Are you trying to scare people?

97
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,180
是吓我自己
{\fs60}No, it's to scare me.

98
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,760
随时提醒我内心中的恶犬
{\fs60}Remind me to be aware of the dog in me.

99
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,940
它想袭击其他动物
{\fs60}The dog wants to fuck everything that moves

100
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,940
和击杀弱小同类的狗
{\fs60}Wants to fight and kill weaker dogs.

101
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,000
提醒自己要像个人
{\fs60}I guess it's to remind me to be more human.

102
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,320
做条狗和做个人不是一个概念么？
{\fs60}Isn't being a dog part of being human?

103
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,210
也许你生来就是一条狗呢？
{\fs60}What if that's the best part of you? The dog part.

104
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,140
其实我们就是两条腿的狗
{\fs60}What if you're really just a two-legged dog?

105
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,080
你得去看心理医生了
{\fs60}You need to see somebody.

106
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,670
这里臭死了
{\fs60}Stinks in here.

107
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,560
我总想在有生之年做件大事
{\fs60}I'd always wanted to do something big with my life

108
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,070
只是不知道要做什么
{\fs60}I just didn't know what.

109
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,080
但我意识到
{\fs60}Anyhow, I figured,

110
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,820
如果我真要去卖枪
{\fs60}if I was going into the gun trade,

111
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,640
就得干大买卖
{\fs60}I was going aim high.

112
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,220
维塔利，别鬼混了，我要和你谈谈
{\fs60}Vitaly, stop fucking around. I want to talk to you.

113
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,930
你每天看报纸吗？
{\fs60}You read the newspapers, Vit?

114
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,700
报纸？每天都一样
{\fs60}Newspaper? It's always the same.

115
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,350
没错
{\fs60}You're right.

116
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,120
每天都有人在枪战
{\fs60}Every day there's people shooting each other.

117
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,980
当我看到这种报道时 你猜我会干嘛？
{\fs60}You know what I do when I see that?

118
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,950
看他们用什么枪 心想为什么不是我卖的枪
{\fs60}I look to see what guns they're using and I think to myself, why not my guns?

119
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,560
你要开个枪店？
{\fs60}What, are you opening a gun shop?

120
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,880
美国的枪店已经比麦当劳还多了
{\fs60}Already more of those in than McDonald's.

121
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,060
即使这附近的黑帮这么多利润还是不够
{\fs60}Even with all the gangsters around here, the margins are too low.

122
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,200
-你已经算出能赚多少？ -当然！
{\fs60}You've figured the margins? Sure.

123
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,060
帮派的火拼算个啥！
{\fs60}Forget gang wars.

{\fs60}Between countries.

126
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,740
尤里 你他娘的懂个屁枪
{\fs60}Yuri, what the fuck do you know about guns?

127
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,420
我知道咱们得干
{\fs60}I know which end I'd rather be on.

128
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,820
我做成了第一笔生意
{\fs60}I made the first sale.

129
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,880
这买卖咱们已经在干了
{\fs60}We're already in business.

130
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,140
呃...咱们？
{\fs60}Whoa, whoa. We?

131
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,230
我要个合伙人
{\fs60}I need a partner.

132
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,360
我不知道...
{\fs60}I don't know,

133
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,940
我不知道，尤里，我不知道...
{\fs60}I don't know, Yuri. I don't know.

134
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,880
维塔利，我喝过你煮的罗宋汤
{\fs60}Vitaly, I've tasted your borscht.

135
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,000
你不是那块料
{\fs60}You're no fucking chef.

136
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,640
我可以在餐馆吃白食 但我还是不在那儿吃
{\fs60}I can eat in the restaurant for free and I still don't eat there.

137
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,210
去你妈的
{\fs60}Fuck you.

138
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,370
咱们一生无所事事
{\fs60}We're doing nothing with our lives.

139
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,060
我的意思是，现在的生活是一团糟！
{\fs60}I mean, this is shit!

140
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,160
的确
{\fs60}It's true.

141
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,280
但或许什么也不做，也比做这个好
{\fs60}But maybe doing nothing's better than doing this.

142
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,540

{\fs60}I need you.

{\fs60}may I interest you in the shoulder-fired SA-7 surface-to-air missiles?

147
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,400
中国制，过时的型号
{\fs60}The older Chinese model.

148
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,840
用在现代军事战机上或许不行
{\fs60}Not so effective against modern military aircraft.

149
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,620
不过打打商业客机还是挺不错的
{\fs60}But deadly if used against a commercial airliner.

150
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,420
$850而已，等于是送给你了
{\fs60}I'm giving them away at 8-50.

151
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,390
那是80年代，冷战尚未结束
{\fs60}In the '80s, and the Cold War was far from thawed

152
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,670
多数的交易是政府之间的
{\fs60}Most of the deals were government-to-government.

153
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,460
几乎都是私人军火俱乐部 而且主席都是终生职
{\fs60}It was a mostly private club with a lifetime club president.

154
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,120
就是他
{\fs60}That's him.

155
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,940
那个大人物？

{\fs60} Angola, Mozambique, those Exocet missiles in the Falklands.

158
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,050
火药还没发明前，他就已经在卖枪
{\fs60}He was selling guns before there was gunpowder.

159
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,570
马上回来
{\fs60}Be right back.

怀斯先生...怀斯先生！
{\fs60}Mr. Weisz? Mr. Weisz!

161
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,810
没关系，他们只是谈一谈
{\fs60}It's okay, they're talking.

162

我有一个生意企划

166
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,390
或许我们能讨论一下
{\fs60}and I thought perhaps we could discuss it.

167
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,790
我想我们不是做同一种生意
{\fs60}I don't think you and I are in the same business.

168
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,600
你以为我只是卖枪的军火商，对吧？
{\fs60}You think I just sell guns, don't you?

169
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,880
不对！我是有立场的
{\fs60}I don't. I take sides.

170
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,680
但两伊战争中，您卖过军火给双方
{\fs60}But in the Iran-lraq war you sold guns to both sides.

171
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,100
你有没想过，或许我想让两边都输
{\fs60}Did you ever consider that I wanted both sides to lose?

172
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,010
用枪杆来换个政府，比用选票更有效
{\fs60}Bullets change governments far surer than votes.

173

朋友，你来错地方了
{\fs60}You're in the wrong place, my young friend.

这里不是玩票的人该来的

{\fs60}Curious how you always revert to your native tongue in moments of extreme anger.

177
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,660

你叫什么名字来着？
{\fs60}What's your name again?

181
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,600
我和维塔利只能做地下买卖
{\fs60}The only option for Vitaly and me was under-the-counter gunrunning.

{\fs60}I got my first break in Lebanon after the suicide bombing.

{\fs60}When the United States leaves a war zone...

186
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,920
他们通常不把武器带走
{\fs60}they generally don't take their munitions.

187
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,450
因为运回去 比买新的还贵
{\fs60}It costs more to bring it back than to buy new stock.

188
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,800
我们是按公斤卖的
{\fs60}So, we sell by the kilo.

189
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,480
虽然是二手货 但还是很好用
{\fs60}They're secondhand weapons,but they're still okay.

这些才是最好的
{\fs60}and pounds-fucking-sterling.

当然，美国陆军也插了一脚
{\fs60}Of course, the U.S. Army got a piece of the action.

{\fs60}Army salaries were no better then than they are today.

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,030
妈妈是火箭发射器
{\fs60}Rocket launchers were "mothers."

247
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,280
孩子是火箭
{\fs60}The rockets, "children."

248
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,240
AK-47自动步枪是天使王
{\fs60}The AK-47 assault rifle was the "Angel King."

249
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,260
我是尤里 嗯...是...拉伍...
{\fs60}It's Yuri... Yeah. Well, Raoul...

250
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,810
拉伍，天使王明天会到
{\fs60}Raoul, the Angel King will arrive tomorrow.

251
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,020
你也是，哈利路亚，呵呵
{\fs60}Hallelujah to you, too.

252
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,830
如果我不出纰漏的话
{\fs60}The point is, if I've done my job right

253
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,560
武器禁运法根本无法执行
{\fs60}an arms embargo should be practically impossible to enforce.

254
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,160
什么？
{\fs60}What?

255
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,960
妈的，慢慢讲！
{\fs60}Okay, just slow the fuck down.

256
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,690
我不知道你在说什么
{\fs60}I can't understand you.

257
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,480
“走漏消息”是什么意思？
{\fs60}Wha-What do you mean, tipped off?

258
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,180
他们知道我们在哪儿？ 他们在哪儿？
{\fs60}They know where we are? Well, where are they?

259
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,430
我还有多少时间？ 不多了？
{\fs60}Well, how long have I got? Not long?

260
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,510
啥意思？妈的！
{\fs60}What does that mean? Shit!

261
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,360
要我甩掉他们吗？ 用这种船？
{\fs60}Do we try to lose them? On this?

262
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,910
尤里，我们得避一避
{\fs60}Yuri, we have to get off this thing.

263
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,460
不，谁也不准离开
{\fs60}No. No one's going anywhere.

264
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,790
减速，减到非常慢 给我争取点时间
{\fs60}Slow, dead slow. Buy me time.

265
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,150
是，我是尤里
{\fs60}Yeah, it's Yuri.

266
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,210
把那个蠢旗摘下来！
{\fs60}Get that fucking rag down!

267
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,250
我需要另一个船名
{\fs60}I need another handle for this tub.

268
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,920
和我们大小和吨位相当的
{\fs60}Something in our weight class.

269
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,170
你，快下去 我们要换名字了
{\fs60}You! Over the side. We're changing the name. Now!

270
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,620
现在！当然要真的名字！
{\fs60}Yes, it's got to check out.

271
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,120
就我来说
{\fs60}The way I look at it,

272
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,440
名字不重要
{\fs60}what's in a name?

273
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,070
有短一点的名字吗？
{\fs60}Have you got a shorter name?

274
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,240
我常更换船和飞机注册的名字
{\fs60}I'd often changed the registration of a ship or a plane...

275
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,320
但从来没有这么急过
{\fs60}...but never on such short notice.

276
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,330
妈的，来得真快！
{\fs60}Damn! They're hauling.

277
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,680
什么？KONO？怎么拼？
{\fs60}What? Kono? How do you spell that?

278
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,660
K-O-N-O，很好
{\fs60}K-O-N-O, okay, well, that's good.

279
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,730
KONO，K-O-N-O
{\fs60}Kono, K-O-N-O.

280
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,910
挂什么国旗？荷兰，好
{\fs60}What are we flying? Dutch? Got it.

281
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,390
拿个荷兰国旗给我
{\fs60}Vit, get me a Dutch flag, will you?

282
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:51,670
快，否则我把你扔到海里
{\fs60}Faster! Or I'll send your ass in!

283
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,670
尤里，找不到荷兰  - 什么！？
{\fs60}Yuri, I don't have Dutch!   - What?

284
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,870
有比利时的
{\fs60}I've got Belgian.

285
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,240
有屁用 刚漆上的船名是在荷兰注册的
{\fs60}What the fuck use is that? He's painting a name registered in the fucking Netherlands.

286
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,350
我有个法国国旗  - 所以呢？
{\fs60}I've got a French flag.   - So?

287
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,630
横过来...
{\fs60}Turn it sideways...

288
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,590
就是荷兰
{\fs60}...it's Dutch.

289
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,670
这就是为什么你是我弟弟
{\fs60}That's why you're my brother.

290
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,340
好极了
{\fs60}All right, good!

291
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,180
每个人都要装无辜样
{\fs60}Everybody look innocent now.

292
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,090
俗话说，人人都有个价码
{\fs60}They say every man has his price.

293
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,930
但不是每个人都能得到
{\fs60}But not every man gets it.

294
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,040
国际警察杰克·瓦伦丁就无法被收买
{\fs60}Interpol Agent Jack Valentine couldn't be bought.

295
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,440
至少用钱买不到
{\fs60}At least, not with money.

296
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,950
对杰克来说，荣誉才是他的价码
{\fs60}For Jack, glory was the prize.

297
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,590
嗯...是柯诺号，不是克里斯多号
{\fs60}Yeah, it's the Kono; it's not the Kristol.

298
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,270
柯诺，K-O-N-O
{\fs60}Kono, K-O-N-O.

299
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,720
这船没问题，长官
{\fs60}It's clean, sir.

300
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,090
没问题？
{\fs60}It's clean?

301
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,090
可看起来不像
{\fs60}It sure doesn't look clean.

302
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,690
我要登船检查
{\fs60}I'm going to go aboard.

303
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,590
发讯号让他们以为 克里斯多号在阿鲁巴岛南方
{\fs60}Phone in a sighting of the Kristol south of Aruba.

304
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,880
即使当我遭遇称职的国际警察时
{\fs60}Even when I was up against an overzealous agent...

305
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,950
我还是有很多方法来防止他们搜查
{\fs60}...I had a number of methods for discouraging a search.

306
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,940
我经常把装军火的箱子标示成“农用机械”
{\fs60}I routinely mislabeled my arms shipments "Farm Machinery."

307
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,020
我还将集装箱标识为有化学辐射
{\fs60}And I have yet to meet the lowly paid customs official...

308
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,640
我还没见过哪个低薪的海关人员
{\fs60}who will open a container marked

309
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,920
会愿意打开“辐射废料”的箱子来核对
{\fs60} "Radioactive Waste" to verify its contents.

310
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,960
不过我最喜欢的技俩是一箱
{\fs60}But my personal favorite is the unique combination...

311
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,240
在热带烈阳下晒了一星期的马铃薯
{\fs60}of week-old potatoes and tropical heat.

312
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,000
真难闻
{\fs60}Smells.

313
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,240
长官，克里斯多号在我们北方出现
{\fs60}Sir, Sighting of the Kristol, due north.

314
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:08,910
最重要的是我会收买一些情报人员
{\fs60}Most importantly, I kept a number of intelligence people on the payroll to supply their colleagues

315
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,560
以便适时地向同僚提供假情报
{\fs60}with counterintelligence.

316
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,080
我们走
{\fs60}Let's go.

317
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,220
走私枪支的第二条守则是
{\fs60}The second rule of gunrunning is:

318
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,190
每次都要确定能收到钱
{\fs60}Always ensure you have a foolproof way to get paid.

319
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,930
最好是
{\fs60}Preferably in advance...

320
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,140
事先付款至海外的帐户
{\fs60}ideally to an off-shore account.

321
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,860
这就是为什么 我如此小心筛选客户的原因
{\fs60}That's why I chose my customers so carefully.

322
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,630
我喜欢军阀和独裁者
{\fs60}Say what you like about warlords and dictators...

323
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,230
他们通常很讲义气
{\fs60}they tend to have a highly developed sense of order.

324
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,440
总是准时付钱
{\fs60}They always pay their bills on time.

325
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,760
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(946,895.3)}这是什么？

326
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,900
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(956,895.3)}6公斤的纯海洛因

327
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:52,740
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(950,841.3)}我总不能把这个存进曼哈顿的银行吧

328
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,910
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(954,833.2)}听请楚咯，你这混蛋 你该感谢我才对

329
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,710
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(962,841.3)}你查了今天市场的价格吗？

330
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:05,500
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(956,838.6)}上周在边界有一堆货被查扣 现在价格涨了三成

331
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,260
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(970,892.6)}我是卖枪的，不是贩毒的

332
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,470
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(954,895.3)}多样化能降低风险

333
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,800
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(954,895.3)}我是有原则的

334
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,260
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(946,895.3)}你不给钱，我就不玩了

335
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,310
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(946,895.3)}去你妈的

336
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,460
你想干嘛？
{\fs60}What are you doing?

337
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
操你！
{\fs60}Fuck you!

338
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,280
操你！
{\fs60}Fuck you!

339
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,560
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(936,835.9)}别操了 总有解决办法

340
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,060
不要，维！
{\fs60}No, Vit!

341
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,070
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(980,892.6)}成交！成交！

342
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,850
走私枪支第一条也是最重要的守则是
{\fs60}The first and most important rule of gunrunning...

343
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,240
别被自己买卖的商品打伤了
{\fs60}is never get shot with your own merchandise.

344
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,650
你没事儿吧？
{\fs60}Are you okay?

345
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,950
我想是
{\fs60}I think so.

346
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,390
我们现在该怎么办？
{\fs60}So what do we do now?

347
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,690
我们庆祝一下
{\fs60}Let's celebrate.

348
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,740
那个北哥伦比亚的游击份子说得没错
{\fs60}That narco guerilla had his facts right.

349
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,120
美国边境的缉毒行动
{\fs60}After shipping it stateside, the return on that blow

350
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,000
的确为我带来可观的利润
{\fs60}netted me a healthy profit.

351
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,710
要不是半途丢了一公斤
{\fs60}It would have been even better,

352
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,700
利润会更可观
{\fs60}except one kilo never made it back.

353
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,120
维塔利?
{\fs60}Vitaly?

354
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,520
维!
{\fs60}Vit!

355
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,010
直至今日我还不知道维在逃避什么
{\fs60}To this day I don't know what Vitaly was running away from.

356
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,820
或许是在逃避他自己吧
{\fs60}Maybe just from Vitaly.

357
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,680
12天后 我在两千哩外
{\fs60}I found him twelve days, two thousand miles,

358
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,410
玻利维亚边境的寄宿屋子里找到了他
{\fs60}and one hundred and fifty grams later

359
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,030
还吸了150公克
{\fs60}in a Bolivian boarding house.

360
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,170
没想到，我的梦中情人 早我一步来到了这里
{\fs60}Of course, my dream girl had gone there before me.

361
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,090
维!
{\fs60}Vit!

362
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,440
快开门!
{\fs60}Come on!

363
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,980
妈的!尤里回来了
{\fs60}Fuck, Yuri's back.

364
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,260
我哥哥，尤里
{\fs60}It's my brother, Yuri.

365
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,410
我的大哥哥
{\fs60}He's my big brother.

366
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,320
妈的，那是什么？
{\fs60}What the fuck is that?

367
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,520
乌克兰
{\fs60}Ukraine.

368
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,260
虽然当时我还年幼，但我记得
{\fs60}I was young, but I remember.

369
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:40,620
瞧，我从奥德萨...

我从没搞清楚偶而吸毒玩玩和吸上的毒瘾有什么分别
{\fs60}I never understood what separated the recreational drug user from the habitual.

401
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:38,210
上帝见证 还好我自己没有吸上瘾
{\fs60}But for the grace of God it could've been me snorting lines as long as the Belt Parkway.

402
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,240
但是我还是没能逃脱
{\fs60}However, I wasn't entirely free

某种令人上瘾的东西

我们那儿的街坊邻居说

能走出这里才算有出息

关系发展到最后也是撒谎和欺骗
{\fs60}Since that's where they usually end up anyway...

不如就这样开始吧
{\fs60}it's a logical place to start.

就那儿，别动

{\fs60}I knew Ava was not the kind of woman to be seduced by a ride in a private jet

434
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,060
除非飞机是我的

是你的飞机吗？

那是我的名字

437
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,660
我当然在撒谎
{\fs60}Of course, I was lying.

438

飞机是租的，还有车子和身上的西装
{\fs60}The plane was rented, like the car and even the suit I was standing in

439

{\fs60}Ava wasn't looking anywhere but in my eyes.

{\fs60}Don't apologize. I put clothes on for a living.

00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,450
我倒希望你脱下来
{\fs60}A least you're not taking them off.

假如摄影师能来那我就会脱了

{\fs60}This is no accident, is it, Yuri?

459
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,550
这是命运的安排
{\fs60}It feels like fate.

460
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,220
我不信命运
{\fs60}I don't believe in fate.

{\fs60}Is that a view, or is that a view?

{\fs60}I know you're not everything you seem.

481
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,580
别担心，我不会问很多问题的
{\fs60}Don't worry, I won't ask a lot of questions.

482
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,150
因为我不想听你撒谎
{\fs60}I don't want to hear you lie.

483
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,950
你常挺而走险
{\fs60}You take risks.

484
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,750
答应我，别把全家赔上了
{\fs60}Just promise me you won't risk us.

485
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,110
这就是爱上梦中情人的麻烦
{\fs60}That's the trouble with falling in love with a dream girl.

486
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,100
她们会突然成为现实
{\fs60}They have a habit of becoming real.

487
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,540
见到维塔利，我从没这么高兴过

{\fs60}Dance! Dance! We have to dance!

{\bord0\shad4\fad(400,300)\fs75\pos(496,889.9)}纽约 - 12月25日 - 1991

497
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,050
我依旧超支度日
{\fs60}I was still living way beyond my means.

498
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,210
房贷超高 以信用卡养信用卡
{\fs60}Mortgaged to the hilt, using one credit card to pay another.

499
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:18,810
我以前宠惯了她现在只好拼命想办法
{\fs60}Anything to keep Ava in the style to which she had thanks largely to me

500
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,130
才能维持她以往的生活水平

艾娃，这太贵重了

突然间
{\fs60}Then suddenly,

504
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,390
我所有的圣诞礼物都一起来了
{\fs60}all my Christmases came at once.

00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:30,100
尼奇，你会走啦!好孩子!
{\fs60}Nicki, you did it! Good boy!

506

这才像我孙子!
{\fs60}That's my grandson!

507
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,820
尤里，快来看你儿子在干嘛
{\fs60}Yuri, don't you want to see what your son is doing?

508
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:37,100

{\fs60}Whoever said it's better to give than receive...

509
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,600
一定没收过
{\fs60}...never got a Christmas present like the one I got...

510
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,620
像1991年戈巴契夫给我这样的礼物
{\fs60}in 1991 from Mikhail Gorbachev.

511
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,820
到底怎么啦？
{\fs60}What the hell's the matter?

512
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,430
结束啦！结束啦！
{\fs60}It's over!

513
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,460
什么结束啦？
{\fs60}What's over?

514
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,960
妈的，冷战，苏联，邪恶帝国
{\fs60}The Cold-fucking-War! The Soviet-fucking Union

515
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,280
他说结束了
{\fs60}The Evil fucking-Empire! Mikhail's saying no mas.

516
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,540
一切都结束了！
{\fs60}He's throwing in the towel.

517
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,370
都完了!
{\fs60}It's over!

518
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,690
你儿子会走路了
{\fs60}Your son is walking.

519
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,420
真棒，甜心
{\fs60}That's incredible, honey.

520
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,180
起码他会给宗教自由
{\fs60}At least they'll get religious freedom.

521
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,880
希望如此
{\fs60}Let's hope so.

522
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,790
我想回去看看
{\fs60}I think I'll go back for a visit.

523
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,460
你和狄米奇叔叔还有连络吗？
{\fs60}Do you stay in touch with Uncle Dmitri?

524
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,300
我不是傻瓜，尤里
{\fs60}I'm not a fool, Yuri.

525
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,390
我不信你回去，是要卖百事可乐
{\fs60}I don't think you're going to Odessa to sell Pepsi-Cola.

526
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,910
这是你希望被后人纪念的方式吗？
{\fs60}Is this how you want to be remembered?

527
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,270
我根本不希望留名青史
{\fs60}I don't want to be remembered at all.

528
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,720
如果是那样，就表示我已经死了
{\fs60}I'm being remembered, it means I'm dead.

529
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,650
圣诞快乐
{\fs60}Merry-fucking-Christmas!

530

维塔利，这是谁？
{\fs60}Who is this, Vitaly?

531
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,750
我叫天使
{\fs60}I'm Angel.

532

她真的是天使
{\fs60}Her name really is Angel.

533
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:51,730
她真是
{\fs60}She's a fairy.

534
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,510
让我把她放在圣诞树顶
{\fs60}Let's put her on top of the Christmas tree.

535
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,920

我要回乌克兰
{\fs60}I'm going back to Ukraine.

541
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,540
我想念奥德萨
{\fs60}I miss Odessa.

542
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,130
我想你
{\fs60}I miss you.

543
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,380
我也想你
{\fs60}I miss you.

544
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,340
小心啊，尤里 你卖的东西是可以杀人的
{\fs60}Be careful, Yuri. Those things you sell kill.

545
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,870
你的心
{\fs60}Inside.

546
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,020
你过度紧张了
{\fs60}You're high.

547
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,740
也许吧
{\fs60}That's true.

548

我觉得不到四万

{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(962,900.7)}你是卖枪的？

624
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:33,480
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(936,833.2)}或许你可以来我房间 我让你瞧瞧我的

625
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,440
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(958,889.9)}火炮

626
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,470
看上去你似乎摸不着门路
{\fs60}You look a little lost, Simeon.

627
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,330
是世界改变得太快了吗？
{\fs60}Is the world changing too fast?

628
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,300
我这不是找来了吗？
{\fs60}I'm here, aren't I?

629
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,940
不全然
{\fs60}Not all of you, I think.

630
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,960
你替中情局贩卖军火赚了大钱
{\fs60}You've gotten so rich selling for the CIA

631
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,590
但你似乎还无法
{\fs60}you can't seem to get that ideology

632
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,920
放下身段
{\fs60}completely out of your head.

633
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,510
冷战时我不得不如此
{\fs60}Oh, the Cold War had its uses.

634
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:57,670
得首先考虑双方紧张的关系
{\fs60}Kept the tensions frozen.

635
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,010
现在很难取舍
{\fs60}Now it's harder to determine

636
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:02,640
该站在哪一方
{\fs60}which side one's on.

637
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,940
事情变得比较复杂了
{\fs60}Things have become more complicated.

638
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,470
不，是变简单了
{\fs60}No, it's gotten simpler.

639
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,250
政治考量已经不存在于军火业了
{\fs60}There's no place in gunrunning for politics anymore,

640
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:12,640
我卖给左翼，也卖给右翼
{\fs60}I sell to leftists and rightists.

641
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,170
甚至和平主义者
{\fs60}I sell to pacifists,

642
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,360
不过他们不是常客啦
{\fs60}but they're not the most regular of customers.

643
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:19,050
你如果不卖武器
{\fs60}Of course, you're not a true internationalist...

644
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,460
去打击自己的国家
{\fs60}...until you've supplied weapons

645
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:21,950
你就算不上是个国际军火贩
{\fs60}to kill your own countrymen.

646
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,870
现今这种混乱的局势不能继续下去
{\fs60}This current state of chaos won't last forever.

647
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,510
必须重新建立秩序
{\fs60}There'll have to be order.

648
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,390
与其互相敌对
{\fs60}Instead of cutting each other's throats,

649
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,280
咱们不如合作
{\fs60}it may be beneficial if we work together.

650
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:38,940
如何？
{\fs60}What do you think?

651
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:43,560
我认为如何？
{\fs60}What do I think?

652
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,790
我认为你现在才是玩票的
{\fs60}I think you are the amateur now,

653
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:49,850
你应该按照你的直觉去做
{\fs60}and I think you should go with your instincts.

654
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:51,280
你的第一个直觉
{\fs60}With your first instinct.

655
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,830
过去的我不配给你提鞋
{\fs60}I'm the same man who was not good enough for you before

656
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:57,860
现在还是不配
{\fs60}and I'm just not good enough for you now.

657
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:15,180
军火贩子之间开战有个麻烦
{\fs60}The problem with gunrunners going to war

658
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,070
就是双方都有用不尽的弹药
{\fs60}is that there's no shortage of ammunition.

659
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:25,390
这就是咱们这行老前辈们总在顾忌的
{\fs60}This was the chaos that the Old Guard had always feared.

660
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:29,610
他们担心 我会搞坏军火商的名声
{\fs60}As far as they were concerned,I was giving arms dealers a bad name.

661
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,830
但是他们无法向优化商务局举报我
{\fs60}But they could hardly report me to the Better Business Bureau.

662
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,390
乌克兰不是唯一一个
{\fs60}And Ukraine wasn't the only former state...

663
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:40,080
拥有没有工资的军队和很多军火的国家
{\fs60}with an unpaid army and stockpiles of guns.

664
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,850
这里还有保加利亚，匈牙利 波兰，巴拉如斯
{\fs60}There was Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Belarus...

665
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,330
他们全都是
{\fs60}all there for the taking.

666
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:54,580
在苏联兵工厂里的所有武器中
{\fs60}Of all the weapons in the vast Soviet arsenal...

667
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:58,100
没有一种像AK47
{\fs60}nothing was more profitable than Avtomat Kalashnikova,

668
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,860
或者叫卡拉希尼可夫
{\fs60}model of 1947,

669
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:03,850
更赚钱的
{\fs60}more commonly known as the AK-47... or kalashnikov.

670
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,950
它是世界上最流行的冲锋枪
{\fs60}It's the world's most popular assault rifle

671
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,050
战士最喜爱的武器
{\fs60}a weapon all fighters love.

672
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:13,580
由9磅金属和4英尺长木头制成
{\fs60}An elegantly simple nine-pound amalgamation of forged steel and plywood.

673
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:16,260
它不会坏，卡壳，或者过热
{\fs60}It doesn't break, jam, or overheat.

674
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,580
就算它被泥土或者沙子覆盖还是可以正常的开火
{\fs60}It will shoot whether it's covered in mud or filled with sand.

675
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,270
它的使用非常简单 就算一个小孩都可以使用它
{\fs60}It's so easy, even a child can use it

676
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:23,430
而且他们的确在使用它
{\fs60}and they do.

677
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:25,540
苏联把枪放到他们的钱币上
{\fs60}The Soviets put the gun on a coin.

678
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,750
莫桑比克把枪的图案放在国旗上
{\fs60}Mozambique put it on their flag.

679
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:29,600
自从冷战结束后
{\fs60}Since the end of the Cold War,

680
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:33,160
AK47成为了苏联主要的出口货物
{\fs60}the Kalashnikov has become the Russian people's greatest export.

681
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:35,450
接着是伏特加酒，鱼子酱
{\fs60}After that comes vodka, caviar,

682
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,030
和有自杀倾向的诗人
{\fs60}and suicidal novelists.

683
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,310
有一点我确定
{\fs60}One thing's for sure

684
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:41,430
没有人想排队去买他们的车
{\fs60}no one was lining up to buy their cars.

685
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:58,650
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(962,900.7)}他娘的什么文件

686
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:05,780
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(962,900.7)}听我说，中尉

687
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,910
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(962,900.7)}把他们留在那里，越长越好

688
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,370
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(958,1068.1)}战斗到死




莫斯科支持我们

689
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,450
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(962,900.7)}这是我的命令

690
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,890
我以为你应该躲着这些人
{\fs60}I thought you supposed watching out for these people.

691
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:15,920
我怎么躲
{\fs60}How can I?

692
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:18,300
你不停卖我的直升机
{\fs60}You keep selling my helicopters.

693
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:19,860
你太贪钱了，尤里
{\fs60}You are too greedy, Yuri!

694
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,200
我不能永远的挡住他
{\fs60}I can't hold him forever.

695
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:23,410
我有许可书
{\fs60}I've got paperwork.

696
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:25,060
对战斗直升机无效
{\fs60}Not for the gunships.

697
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,920
你知道如果我们被抓了
{\fs60}You know the penalty for sanction-busting.

698
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,670
卖军用直升机可是一项重罪
{\fs60}Selling the military helicopter is a major violation.

699
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,360
军用直升机
{\fs60}Military helicopter.

700
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,910
这不是一架军用直升机
{\fs60}It's not a military helicopter.

701
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,840
这是一架救援直升机
{\fs60}It's a rescue helicopter.

702
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,050
快干活，小子
{\fs60}Get to work, son.

703
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,690
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(956,898)}没问题

704
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,660
法律在我们这边
{\fs60}The law's on our side.

705
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:08,740
好的，让我看一看你的许可书
{\fs60}All right, let me see your papers.

706
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,620
不要，把枪拿开
{\fs60}No-no-no, put that away.

707
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,450
让我看一看你的许可书
{\fs60}See your papers.

708
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,140
尤里·奥洛夫
{\fs60}Yuri Orlov.

709
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,650
奥洛夫先生总是在正确的时间 出现在错误的地方
{\fs60}Mr. Orlov, always In the wrong place at the right time.

710
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:18,850
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(956,898)}这到底是怎么回事？

711
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,680
我们以前见过
{\fs60}We've met before.

712
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:23,180
在哥伦比亚的海岸线附近
{\fs60}Off the coast Colombia.

713
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,420
那船叫什么名字来着?
{\fs60}What was the name of that freighter?

714
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:28,320
柯诺号还是克里斯多号?
{\fs60}I can't remember, was it the Kono or the Kristol?

715
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,680
船上的船员给那艘船起了很多名字
{\fs60}The crew called that vessel a lot of names.

716
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,840
没有一个是好名字
{\fs60}None repeatable in polite company.

717
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:33,980
回答你的问题
{\fs60}Answer the question.

718
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,080
哦，新型的MP5
{\fs60}The new MP-5.

719
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,780
你想要个消音器吗？
{\fs60}Would you like a silencer for that?

720
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,260
我要看你的许可证
{\fs60}I need to see your papers.

721
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,250
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(956,898)}离我远一点

722
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,180
狄米奇
{\fs60}Dmitri!

723
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,850
这架直升机的使用者证明书上写着
{\fs60}The end-user certificate for this aircraft...

724
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:53,070
沃克纳·瓦梢
{\fs60}states "Burkina Faso."

725
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:55,480
真不错
{\fs60}Nice, very nice.

726
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,750
是你自己打的吗？
{\fs60}Did you type this up yourself?

727
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:59,270
这架直升机是用来执行人道主义任务的
{\fs60}The helicopter is to be used on humanitarian missions.

728
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:01,310
噢，你是一个人道主义者
{\fs60}Oh, so you're a humanitarian?

729
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,460
当然是
{\fs60}Oh, absolutely.

730
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,200
这是一架军用直升机
{\fs60}This is a military aircraft.

731
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,130
现在不是了 - 听他讲
{\fs60}Not anymore. - Listen to the nephew!

732
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,450
他们能用由军用直升机 改装的民用直升机做什么
{\fs60}What can they do with military hardware but convert it to civilian use?

733
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,680
如果是因为这架直升机死了人
{\fs60}The only way you could die from this baby

734
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,940
那是因为你被投掷的食物砸死了
{\fs60}now is if a food drop hits you.

735
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:19,140
这边的东西呢？
{\fs60}And this stuff over here, huh?

736
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,220
他们也用来行人道主义任务吗？
{\fs60}Is it going to Burkina Faso... Ah,

737
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,290
不同的客户，不同的地址
{\fs60}but to a different client at a different address.

738
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,980
只是一个巧合是吗？
{\fs60}That's just a coincidence is that it?

739
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:27,470
你以为我是一个大傻瓜吗？
{\fs60}Do you take me for a complete fucking fool?

740
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:28,780
并不是很傻
{\fs60}Not complete, sir.

741
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:31,100
我不会打搅你的工作
{\fs60}And while I hesitate to tell your job.

742
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,760
我必须指出
{\fs60}I must point out that when shipped separately,

743
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,370
如果我分开运输武器和直升机
{\fs60}the weapons and the aircraft both comply with current Interpol

744
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,000
都符合现在的国际条约
{\fs60}trade standards and practices.

745
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:38,750
我们都知道
{\fs60}We both know,

746
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:42,540
这只是一个条约上的漏洞
{\fs60}that is an obscene bureaucratic loophole that's gonna be closed

747
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:43,840
这个漏洞不知那天就会消失
{\fs60}any goddamn day.

748
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:45,180
但是现在还没消失
{\fs60}But it's not closed.

749
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:48,820
有些人也许认为 这些集装箱可疑
{\fs60}And while certain people might interpret this cargo as suspicious,

750
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:52,810
感谢上帝 只有可疑是无法给我定罪的
{\fs60}thank God we live in a world, where suspicion alone does not constitute a crime.

751
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:54,100
像你这样的人
{\fs60}And men like you

752
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:55,740
会遵守法律条约
{\fs60}respect the rule of law.

753
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:02,390
我的确是有罪的
{\fs60}I was as guilty as sin,

754
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:03,870
但是瓦伦丁无法证明
{\fs60}but Valentine couldn't prove it.

755
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,800
他是执法人员里很少见的
{\fs60}And he was the rarest breed of law enforcement officer,

756
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,770
尽管他知道我在犯法
{\fs60}the type who knew I was breaking the law,

757
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,840
但是他不会以非法的手段来逮捕我
{\fs60}but wouldn't break it himself to bust me.

758
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:15,050
{\bord0\shad4\fad(400,300)\fs75\pos(336,908.8)}两天后

759
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,920
瓦伦丁并不是唯一想让我没生意做的人
{\fs60}Valentine wasn't the only one trying to put me out of business.

760
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:20,980
狄米奇拒绝了许多其他的军火商
{\fs60}My uncle had turned down a half dozen rival arms dealers,

761
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,260
有时他们的条件比我的要好
{\fs60}sometimes with offers better than mine.

762
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:26,520
但是你不能用钱来买衷心
{\fs60}But to Dmitri, you couldn't put a price on loyalty.

763
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,950
他来这干什么？
{\fs60}What was he doing here?

764
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:42,680
他希望能抢到你的生意
{\fs60}He is hoping to beat your offer.

765
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,980
我告诉他去死吧
{\fs60}I told him to go have intercourse with himself.

766
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,370
但是，尤里
{\fs60}But Yuri

767
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:49,240
你应该多给一些了
{\fs60}You need to make more payoffs.

768
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:51,020
很多人已经知道了 - 不用担心
{\fs60}Too many know. - Don't worry.

769
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,720
我放了很多录像机和烟
{\fs60}There are more VCRs and cigarettes.

770
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:54,250
在你的新车里
{\fs60}I left them in your new car.

771
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:57,630
就连你的敌人都很喜欢那辆车
{\fs60}Even your enemy was admiring that car.

772
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:04,130
我是世界上最幸运的人
{\fs60}I'm the luckiest man alive.

773
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,000
你的确是
{\fs60}You are.

774
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:45,040
喂
{\fs60}Hello.

775
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:45,670
艾娃？
{\fs60}Ava?

776
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,930
亲爱的
{\fs60}Hi, baby.

777
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:50,350
你知道现在几点了吗?
{\fs60}You forgot what time it is?

778
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:51,950
对不起...
{\fs60}Sorry, I...

779
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,310
你的面试怎么样？
{\fs60}How was that your audition?

780
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:58,430
他们改变了他们的要求
{\fs60}They're going in another direction.

781
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:00,770
他们想要一个可以表演的人
{\fs60}Direction with someone who can act.

782
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,050
他们配不上你
{\fs60}They don't deserve you.

783
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,340
你在哪？
{\fs60}Where are you?

784
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:07,450
一切都好吗？
{\fs60}Is everything okay?

785
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,000
不是很好
{\fs60}It was a rough day at the office.

786
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:12,680
回家吧
{\fs60}Come home.

787
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:14,880
很快就回家了 尼克怎么样?
{\fs60}Soon. How's Nicki?

788
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,120
他很想你 我们都想你
{\fs60}He misses you. We both do.

789
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,690
我们没有你感到很孤独
{\fs60}It's lonely without you here.

790
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,470
你知道我不喜欢夜晚
{\fs60}You know I don't like nights.

791
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:25,830
自从我的父母...
{\fs60}Ever since my parents...

792
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,470
尤里，那是什么声音？
{\fs60}Yuri, what's that?

793
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,980
一个聚会
{\fs60}A party.

794
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,050
我该走了
{\fs60}I'd better go.

795
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,050
只是想听一听你的声音
{\fs60}Just wanted to call and hear your voice.

796
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,220
替我亲一下尼克
{\fs60}Kiss Nicki for me.

797
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:42,210
我爱你
{\fs60}I love you.

798
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,990
军火并没有因为狄米奇的死而消失
{\fs60}The pillaging didn't die with my uncle.

799
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:50,640
自从墙倒塌后
{\fs60}After The Wall came down

800
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:53,420
价值3200亿的军火
{\fs60}$32 billion billion dollars worth of arms

801
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,980
被盗然后从乌克兰被买走
{\fs60}were stolen and resold from Ukraine alone,

802
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:58,980
这是20世纪最高的纪录
{\fs60}one of the greatest heists of the 20th Century.

803
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:11,230
{\bord0\shad4\fad(400,300)\fs75\pos(424,906.1)}蒙罗维亚, 利比里 - 1995

804
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:14,940
非洲是最主要的市场
{\fs60}The primary market was Africa.

805
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:17,290
在10年里
{\fs60}Eleven major conflicts involving

806
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:19,420
有11场战斗，23个国家参与
{\fs60}thirty-two countries in less than a decade...

807
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,070
这是军火走私商的天堂
{\fs60}A gunrunner's wet dream.

808
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,420
现在，西方并不关心这些
{\fs60}At the time, the West couldn't care less.

809
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,260
{\an7\fs60}注：波黑战争时期

810
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,260
他们在南斯拉夫有一场白人的战争要打
{\fs60}They had a white war in what was left of Yugoslavia.

811
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:29,240
我最主要在利比里做我的生意
{\fs60}I did the bulk of my business in Liberia...

812
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,630
自由之地
{\fs60}"Land of the Free."

813
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,710
一开始这里是黑人奴隶的自由之地
{\fs60}Originally established as a homeland for freed American slaves,

814
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,800
但是从那之后这些奴隶还是被这个或者另一个人统治着
{\fs60}it's been enslaved by one dictator or another ever since.

815
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:40,010
最新的统治者是受过美国教育的
{\fs60}The latest was American-educated,

816
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,680
自封为总统的安德烈·巴特思
{\fs60}self declared president, Andre Baptiste.

817
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:49,590
尤里先生
{\fs60}Mr. Yuri!

818
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,500
我是安德烈·巴特思二世
{\fs60}I'm Andre Baptiste, Junior.

819
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:57,220
我的父亲想见你
{\fs60}My father would like to meet you.

820
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:58,420
真是荣幸
{\fs60}What an honor.

821
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:00,540
谢谢
{\fs60}Thank him.

822
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:02,590
但是我还有其他生意要做
{\fs60}But unfortunately I have other business.

823
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:05,440
对不起，我很忙
{\fs60}It's a shame, it's a very busy schedule.

824
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:17,410
应该说你没有选择的权利
{\fs60}It is not, as they say, optional.

825
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,600
我的父亲很容易生气
{\fs60}My father is easily offended.

826
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,740
我突然有时间了
{\fs60}My schedule just freed up.

827
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,560
巴布锑总统是我最好的客人
{\fs60}President Baptiste was my best customer

828
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:31,320
但是我不着急去见他
{\fs60}but I was in no hurry to meet him.

829
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:35,890
他消除异己的残忍手段路人皆知
{\fs60}He'd gotten a reputation for routinely hacking off the limbs of those who opposed him.

830
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:38,710
7年的内战
{\fs60}His seven-year civil war has been described...

831
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:42,460
被总结为纯粹为了暴力的战争
{\fs60}as "a relentless campaign of sadistic wanton violence."

832
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:44,870
这就是我将要去见的安迪
{\fs60}That kind of sums up Andy for me.

833
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:49,370
这个转轮很有趣
{\fs60}The Glock is interesting.

834
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:53,080
他是合金制成的
{\fs60}It's made of a polymer composite.

835
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:57,880
这样过机场安检就不会触发警铃
{\fs60}Many of my clients feel they can get through airport security without setting off a lot of bells and whistles.

836
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,590
但是我并不同意这样做
{\fs60}Personally I do not recommend that.

837
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,520
从另一方面来说
{\fs60}On the other hand,

838
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:03,840
如果你想要一种传统的大火力手枪
{\fs60}if you are looking for a traditional wheel gun,

839
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:06,130
没有一种枪可以代替
{\fs60}there is no substitute for the six inches

840
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:08,400
6英寸长的.357毫米马格南
{\fs60}of muzzle energy of a.357 magnum.

841
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:10,980
当然它从不卡壳
{\fs60}And of course, it will never jam.

842
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:15,200
你为什么这么做？
{\fs60}Why did you do that?

843
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:16,340
你说什么？
{\fs60}What did you say?

844
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:19,860
你必须买下它
{\fs60}Now you'll have to buy it.

845
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:21,300
它已经被你用过了
{\fs60}It's a used gun.

846
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,140
我怎么能卖掉用过的枪
{\fs60}How can I sell a used gun?

847
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,140
一把用过的枪
{\fs60}A used gun.

848
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,720
一把用过的枪
{\fs60}A used gun.

849
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:34,810
有趣
{\fs60}That's a good one.

850
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:41,390
你知道吗？现在的年轻人没有纪律
{\fs60}You know there is no discipline with the youth today.

851
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,720
我只是想树立一个榜样 虽然这不容易
{\fs60}I try to set an example but it is difficult, eh?

852
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:47,980
我想这都是MTV的错
{\fs60}Personally, I blame MTV.

853
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,820
一把用过的枪
{\fs60}A used gun.

854
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,820
我想我们可以做生意了
{\fs60}I think you and I, we can do business.

855
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:06,700
如果说我害怕安德烈一世
{\fs60}If I thought I was scared of Andre Senior,

856
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,870
不如说我更害怕安德烈二世
{\fs60}I knew I was scared of Andre Junior.

857
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:11,520
有其父必有其子
{\fs60}Like father, like son.

858
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:14,380
就像果实从来不会掉到离树很远的地方
{\fs60}The guava doesn't fall too far from the tree.

859
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:16,460
他简直是一个食人怪
{\fs60}He was also a cannibal.

860
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:18,600
他们说安德烈会吃掉
{\fs60}They say Andre would eat a victim's heart

861
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:19,950
他的敌人还在跳动的心脏
{\fs60}while it was still beating

862
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,860
这样他可以得到超越常人的力量
{\fs60}to give him superhuman strength.

863
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:32,510
到蒙罗维亚就像到了另一个星球一样
{\fs60}Monrovia itself was like being on another planet.

864
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:34,490
蒙罗维亚星球
{\fs60}Planet Monrovia.

865
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:35,760
从气温来说
{\fs60}From the temperature,

866
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:38,260
它是最接近太阳的星球
{\fs60}it was obviously a planet close to the sun.

867
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,290
我从没见过另一个白人
{\fs60}I rarely saw another white man,

868
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,880
我从来不独自离开这个村庄
{\fs60}and I never left town alone.

869
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,340
这个村庄之外就是地狱的边缘
{\fs60}Outside town was the edge of hell.

870
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:47,710
我连看都不想看
{\fs60}I didn't want to even gaze into it.

871
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:51,870
这就是你住的旅馆 2星级的
{\fs60}This is your hotel. Two stars.

872
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,640
你能带给我蓝博之枪吗？
{\fs60}Can you bring me the gun of Rambo?

873
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,670
第1，2，还是第3集的？
{\fs60}Part one, two, or three?

874
00:55:57,950 --> 00:55:59,380
我只看过第一集
{\fs60}I've only seen part one.

875
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:00,420
M60
{\fs60}The M-60.

876
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,470
你想要带穿甲弹的吗？
{\fs60}Would you like the armor-piercing bullets?

877
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,610
太好了
{\fs60}Please.

878
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,910
我父亲留了一个见面礼在你房间里
{\fs60}My father left a welcoming present in your room.

879
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:09,860
慢慢享受吧
{\fs60}Enjoy.

880
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:28,680
我的天啊，她差点就被砍头了
{\fs60}My God, she nearly got her head cut off.

881
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,690
当我到美国时
{\fs60}When I get to America,

882
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,380
我不会住在那里
{\fs60}I will not live in Brentwood.

883
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,350
2楼
{\fs60}Second floor.

884
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,220
在全球艾滋病最流行的地方
{\fs60}In the most AIDS-infested region of the globe...

885
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,350
4人中就有1人感染
{\fs60}where one in four is infected...

886
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,520
安德烈和我开玩笑的方式
{\fs60}Andre's idea of a joke was to put

887
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:51,020
就是把两个漂亮的女人放到我床上
{\fs60}a young lman and a young Naomi in my bed.

888
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:53,540
而且在方圆100英里内找不到避孕套
{\fs60}And no condom within 100 miles.

889
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:09,640
你好，尤里先生
{\fs60}Hello, Mr. Yuri.

890
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,270
好
{\fs60}Hi.

891
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:15,080
我们很高兴可以使你感觉高兴
{\fs60}We'd be happy to make you happy.

892
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:20,510
我不能，我想要做
{\fs60}Uh, I can't. I'd love to.

893
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:22,380
但是我不能
{\fs60}But I can't.

894
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:24,320
不要担心
{\fs60}Don't worry.

895
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,210
我们没有病
{\fs60}We don't have anything.

896
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:32,480
你怎么知道？
{\fs60}How do you know?

897
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:36,910
我们看起来像有病吗？
{\fs60}Do we look like it?

898
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,880
如果我有艾滋病呢？
{\fs60}What if I have AIDS?

899
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,450
你不担心吗？
{\fs60}Don't you worry?

900
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:43,380
你担心的太多了
{\fs60}You worry too much.

901
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:46,420
为什么你现在担心一个
{\fs60}Why do you worry about something that

902
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:48,230
10年后才会杀死你的病
{\fs60}can kill you in ten years

903
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:52,520
今天就有很多机会你会死
{\fs60}when there are so many things that can kill you today?

904
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:56,000
现在
{\fs60}Now...

905
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,450
我们如何才能使你高兴
{\fs60}...how can we make you happy?

906
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:04,220
离开这里
{\fs60}By leaving.

907
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,610
这些武装到牙齿的儿童
{\fs60}These are my Kalashnikov Kids.

908
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,480
我的童子军
{\fs60}My Boy Brigades.

909
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:18,320
我知道你在想什么
{\fs60}I can see what you are thinking,

910
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,620
但是我们需要所有我们可以用的上的男性
{\fs60}but we need every man we can get.

911
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:22,460
即使他们还没有长大？
{\fs60}Even if they're not men?

912
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,780
从14岁孩子的枪里射出的子弹
{\fs60}A bullet from a fourteen-year-old...

913
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,880
就像从40岁男人的枪里射出的子弹一样致命
{\fs60}...is just as effective as one from a forty-year-old.

914
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,190
也许更致命
{\fs60}Often more effective.

915
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:36,430
没有人可以阻止这场血浴之战
{\fs60}No one can stop this bath of blood.

916
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:37,700
不是血浴之战
{\fs60}It's not "bath of blood."

917
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:38,950
是浴血之战
{\fs60}It's "bloodbath."

918
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,300
谢谢
{\fs60}Thank you.

919
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,120
但是我喜欢这么说
{\fs60}But I prefer it my way.

920
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:59,000
我不会给你出的价钱
{\fs60}I am not going to pay your asking price.

921
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,630
我们并不富有
{\fs60}We are not a rich people. And besides,

922
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:04,830
而且市场上已经充斥着你的枪
{\fs60}the market is already flooded with your Kalashnikovs.

923
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:07,260
你知道在这个国家的某些地方
{\fs60}Do you realize in some parts of my country

924
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,920
你可以用一只鸡换一只枪
{\fs60}you can get one for the price of a chicken?

925
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:10,870
你不能只看单价
{\fs60}But you can't just consider unit price.

926
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,380
还有其他辅助费用
{\fs60}You forget ancillary costs.

927
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,920
伪造文件
{\fs60}End-user certificates need to be forged and notarized,

928
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:16,000
建立空壳公司
{\fs60}Shell companies set up,

929
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:18,220
买保险，还有请临时工
{\fs60}insurance purchased, pilots and crews hired.

930
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,710
贿赂别人的钱也很多
{\fs60}Not to mention bribes.

931
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,640
不贿赂别人
{\fs60}You can't get a nut and bolt out

932
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:23,000
你根本无法进入边界
{\fs60}of the Eastern Bloc without a bribe.

933
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,540
给那个疯子一笔贿赂
{\fs60}There's one bribe for the nut,

934
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:25,950
还有一笔要给那个秃子
{\fs60}another for the bolt.

935
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,690
安迪，安迪 听我说
{\fs60}Andy... Andy, listen to me.

936
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:29,380
这是一个很费钱的生意
{\fs60}This is an expensive proposition.

937
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,050
“安迪”？
{\fs60}"Andy"?

938
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:39,520
我会付你木材或者钻石
{\fs60}I am going to pay you in timber or stones.

939
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:44,550
我当然选钻石
{\fs60}I'll take the stones.

940
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:47,660
我可不能把一棵树装进我的手提箱里
{\fs60}It's kind of hard to get a tree trunk into my hand luggage.

941
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:50,720
我知道你在计划反击
{\fs60}I know you're planning a new offensive.

942
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:52,550
如果你能推迟计划一周
{\fs60}If you can delay a week,

943
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,750
我可以给你装甲车
{\fs60}I can get you armored personnel carriers.

944
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,560
它可以有效的减少你的伤亡人数
{\fs60}They'd greatly reduce your casualties...

945
00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:00,490
还可以给你在战场上的优势
{\fs60}...and give you a significant strategic advantage.

946
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:04,720
你知道他们叫我战争之王
{\fs60}You know, they call me the Lord Of War.

947
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,540
我想你才是
{\fs60}But perhaps it is you.

948
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,520
不是战争之王，应该叫军阀
{\fs60}It's not "Lord Of War," it's "Warlord."

949
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,120
谢谢，但是我喜欢这么说
{\fs60}Thank you, but I prefer it my way.

950
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:22,660
钻石在西非是最常用的货币
{\fs60}Conflict diamonds are a common currency in West Africa,

951
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,940
也叫做血之钻石
{\fs60}also referred to as "blood diamonds"

952
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,720
因为这些钻石往往都被用于资助流血战争
{\fs60}since bloodshed is what they generally finance.

953
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:31,050
在20世纪末期
{\fs60}By the late '90s, my wealth had caught up

954
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,790
我的财富已经和我说谎时讲的差不多了
{\fs60}to my lies about my welth.

955
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:34,640
也许比我说谎时讲的还要多
{\fs60}Even surpassed my lies.

956
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:37,690
我甚至有财力去收藏艺术品
{\fs60}I could even afford to become a patron of the arts.

957
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,420
哇，真不敢相信
{\fs60}It's just that I can't believe it.

958
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:51,040
这当然很棒
{\fs60}Well, of... of course, it's wonderful.

959
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:51,810
我只是...
{\fs60}I just...

960
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:54,660
只是没想到这么快发生
{\fs60}I didn't expect it to happen so soon.

961
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:59,430
是...那...也很好
{\fs60}Yes. Well, that wou-that would be great, too yeah.

962
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:04,160
太好了，真谢谢你
{\fs60}It's wonderful. Thank you so much.

963
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:07,330
是...尤里...好...谢谢...再见
{\fs60}It's... Yuri. Okay, thank you. Bye.

964
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:09,150
刚电话里是那个艺术商
{\fs60}Yuri, that was the dealer on the phone.

965
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:10,490
我卖了第一张画
{\fs60}I just sold my first painting.

966
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,520
哇，真是太棒了
{\fs60}Aah! That's fantastic.

967
01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:15,200
谁买了？
{\fs60}Uh, who bought it?

968
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:16,700
一位要人
{\fs60}It's someone important.

969
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,230
不愿透漏姓名
{\fs60}They want to remain anonymous.

970
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,540
真棒！ -对呀！这次外出都好吗？
{\fs60}This is so wonderful! - How was your trip?

971
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:21,780
哦...差不多啦...
{\fs60}You know, same old, same old.

972
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:22,950
尼奇呢？
{\fs60}Where's Nicki?

973
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:25,430
他睡了，撑不住了
{\fs60}Oh, in bed, I'm sorry. He couldn't stay up.

974
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:26,490
不要紧
{\fs60}That's best.

975
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:28,230
第一副画耶！
{\fs60}My first painting!

976
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,480
我正式成为艺术家啦！
{\fs60}I'm officially an artist!

977
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:32,090
值得干一杯 -谁说不是？
{\fs60}This calls for a drink.  - What doesn't?

978
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,020
好
{\fs60}Hi.

979
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,060
尤里，这是...呃...
{\fs60}Yuri, this is uh...

980
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:38,500
小蜜糖
{\fs60}Candy.

981
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:40,810
小蜜糖！当然咯！
{\fs60}Candy. Of course.

982
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,270
我弟弟的朋友都是...
{\fs60}Any friend of my brother's is a...

983
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:45,660
我弟弟的朋友
{\fs60}friend of my brother's.

984
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,990
好漂亮哦！你的...一切
{\fs60}You have a beautiful... everything.

985
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,430
他当然是
{\fs60}Yes, he does.

986
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:53,780
是...我当然是
{\fs60}Yes, I do.

987
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,230
我要去看看尼奇
{\fs60}I'm going to kiss Nicki goodnight.

988
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,830
老弟，还好吗？
{\fs60}How are you, brother?

989
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:53,850
你知道的...
{\fs60}Well, you know,

990
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:56,770
我是家里的败类
{\fs60}still the resident family fuckup.

991
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,540
嗯...呃...总得有一个吧
{\fs60}Yeah. Well, I guess someone has to do it.

992
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:01,600
恩
{\fs60}Well.

993
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:06,740
艾娃知道你在干嘛，对吧？
{\fs60}Hey, Ava knows, right?

994
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:14,710
我可不想说
{\fs60}I never want to say anything,

995
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:16,520
她不需要了解 她懂的
{\fs60}She doesn't have to know. She understands.

996
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:19,030
她是一个幸存者，跟我一样
{\fs60}She's a survivor, like me.

997
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:21,740
她也许是
{\fs60}She may be a survivor,

998
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:23,040
但她绝对跟你不一样
{\fs60}but she's not like you.

999
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,560
她不知道你怎么负担得起这一切
{\fs60}Really She doesn't know how you pay for all this

1000
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:29,960
我们从不提这事儿
{\fs60}We don't talk about it.

1001
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,780
卖车的会告诉你车有危险？
{\fs60}How many car salesman talk about their work? Huh?

1002
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:37,340
卖香烟的会吗？ 每年他们的商品
{\fs60}How many cigarette salesmen? Both their products kill more people

1003
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:39,140
比我的枪害死更多人
{\fs60}every year than mine.

1004
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:40,900
起码我的商品还有安全栓呢
{\fs60}At least mine has a safety switch.

1005
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,100
那些人不会把工作上的事带回家
{\fs60}If those guys can leave their work at the office,

1006
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:45,420
我也不会
{\fs60}so can I.

1007
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,140
天啊...妈的...你真行！
{\fs60}God damn, you are good!

1008
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:53,440
真的
{\fs60}You really are.

1009
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:56,950
你差点让我相信了
{\fs60}You almost had me convinced.

1010
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:09,080
你能...
{\fs60}Could you...

1011
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:13,370
帮帮我吗？
{\fs60}could you help me out with...

1012
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:21,190
为什么？
{\fs60}Why?

1013
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:24,340
什么？
{\fs60}Why?

1014
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:27,000
为什么？
{\fs60}Why?

1015
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,170
什么为什么？
{\fs60}Why what?

1016
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:31,280
为什么？
{\fs60}Why?

1017
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:32,380
为什么？- 我不知道
{\fs60}Why? I don't know.

1018
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,610
为什么？-  我不知道
{\fs60}Why... I don't know.

1019
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:34,650
什么？
{\fs60}Why what?

1020
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,560
为什么你老闯祸？
{\fs60}Why're you so fucked up all the time?

1021
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:46,400
我就是这样，不知道为什么
{\fs60}Because I am. I don't know.

1022
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:58,960
我不清楚艾娃知道多少...
{\fs60}I didn't know how much Ava really knew...

1023
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:00,340
还是装做看不见
{\fs60}and how much she ignored.

1024
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:03,960
她从不问我为何一个做运输业的
{\fs60}She never questioned how a guy in the transport business

1025
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:06,650
能买得起18克拉的耳环
{\fs60}could afford to give her 18 carat diamond earrings.

1026
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:09,630
我想她也不希望知道答案
{\fs60}I guess she didn't want to hear the answer.

1027
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:11,860
她似乎对我
{\fs60}Mostly, She seemed content

1028
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:15,190
养家的能力很满意 她也认为我对她
{\fs60}that I was a good provider and as far as she was concerned,

1029
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:15,970
很忠实
{\fs60} loyal.

1030
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:18,050
虽然我有在外逢场作戏
{\fs60}Despite the other women...

1031
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:19,540
但每次做爱
{\fs60}I always made love to Ava

1032
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,280
我都把她当成我唯一的女人
{\fs60}as if she was the only one.

1033
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:27,060
我不是说生意都很顺利
{\fs60}I'm not saying I didn't have setbacks.

1034
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:29,310
没有枪子儿跑得快
{\fs60}It's not called gunrunning for nothing.

1035
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:31,160
怎能叫军火贩子
{\fs60}You gotta be fast on your feet.

1036
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,020
有时军火还没运到 革命战争就已经爆发了
{\fs60}Some revolutions blow over the guns even get there.

1037
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:37,410
对我们来说和平比什么代价都大
{\fs60}There's nothing's more expensive for an arms dealer than peace.

1038
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:40,160
协议停火？停火是什么意思？
{\fs60}Truce? What do you mean, truce?

1039
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,590
军火已经在途中了
{\fs60}The guns are already on their way.

1040
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,380
和平谈判！
{\fs60}Peace talks.

1041
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:46,820
好啦...算了...
{\fs60}All right, forget it.

1042
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:48,440
我转运到巴尔干半岛
{\fs60}I'll re-route the shipment to the Balkans.

1043
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,830
当他们说要打仗时
{\fs60}When they talk about war,

1044
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:50,890
他们总是信守承诺的
{\fs60}they keep their word.

1045
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:01,040
有了新一代的军火商
{\fs60}Of course, a new breed of gunrunner

1046
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,800
当然就要有新一代的警察
{\fs60}requires a new breed of cop.

1047
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:09,440
亨利，走派克街
{\fs60}Henry, take Park Avenue.

1048
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,890
带他们去新泽西逛逛
{\fs60}Take 'em on a tour of New Jersey.

1049
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:08,570
尤里...有人朝我们的垃圾箱走来
{\fs60}Yuri, there are men going through our garbage cans.

1050
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:11,810
大概是记者
{\fs60}Well, it's probably just some reporters

1051
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:12,980
找错人了吧
{\fs60}looking for somebody else.

1052
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,760
我总觉得他们不是小报的记者
{\fs60}I have a feeling they don't work for the tabloids.

1053
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,250
尤里...
{\fs60}Yuri...

1054
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,150
我该担心什么吗?
{\fs60}is there anything I should be worried about?

1055
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:25,880
没...没事
{\fs60}No, nothing.

1056
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:26,700
没事？
{\fs60}Nothing?

1057
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,410
我爱你
{\fs60}I love you.

1058
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:30,840
我也爱你
{\fs60}I love you, too.

1059
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:36,360
长官
{\fs60}Sir.

1060
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,340
我现在是最好的，还活着的死亡军火贩
{\fs60}I was now the best merchant of death alive.

1061
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:29,940
虽然我没有一架私人飞机 但我有一整队飞机
{\fs60}I didn't own my own plane, I owned a fleet.

1062
01:08:30,090 --> 01:08:34,450
我每周至少一次运货去利比里亚，拉利昂和象牙海岸
{\fs60}Running guns into Liberia, Sierra Leone, or the lvory Coast at least once a week.

1063
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,920
大部分时间我使用假证件
{\fs60}Most trips I had phony paperwork.

1064
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:38,700
如果赶时间
{\fs60}The deadline was tight

1065
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:39,940
我就只有冒险
{\fs60}and I had to cut corners,

1066
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:41,800
干脆简单到连证件也省了
{\fs60}I had no paperwork at all.

1067
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,180
我也不担心
{\fs60}But I wasn't overly concerned.

1068
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,340
非洲大部份地区没有雷达
{\fs60}There was hardly any radar over most of Africa

1069
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,340
雷达观测员就更少了
{\fs60}and even fewer people to watch it.

1070
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:59,660
转降卡巴拉机场
{\fs60}Charlie Echo India, C-E-I... re-route to Kabala airport...

1071
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:01,820

立刻遵照指示行动
{\fs60}Comply immediately.

1073
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,660
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(1094,898)}尤里，妈的，怎么回事？

1074
01:09:16,930 --> 01:09:18,330
撒登中校，我是尤里
{\fs60}Hello, Southern? It's Yuri.

1075
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:19,660
抱歉打你这个号码
{\fs60}I Sorry to call you on this number.

1076
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,430
国际警察缠上我了
{\fs60}But I've got Interpol's all over my ass.

1077
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:22,820
我现在不能讲话...
{\fs60}I can't know you right now.

1078
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,200
时机不对
{\fs60}It's uh, not a good time.

1079
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:28,250
时机不对！？
{\fs60}Not a good time?

1080
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:32,770
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(970,898)}操！

1081
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:40,550
C-E-I，立刻遵照指示行动
{\fs60}Charlie, Echo, India, comply immediately.

1082
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,970
这是最后的警告
{\fs60}This is your last warning.

1083
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:43,440
妈的，何时第一次警告？
{\fs60}Where was the first fucking warning?

1084
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:45,470
如果愿意遵守就摇动机翼
{\fs60}Rock your wings if you intend to comply

1085
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:46,380
我要下降
{\fs60}I'm putting us down.

1086
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:53,620
降落我一定会被抓
{\fs60}If you land, we're going away.

1087
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:54,510
我没证件
{\fs60}I don't have paperwork.

1088
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:55,800
我们就快要爆炸了!
{\fs60}We're in a flying fucking bomb!

1089
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:57,440
他们向我们开火了
{\fs60}They're firing bullets at our bullets.

1090
01:09:57,510 --> 01:09:58,530
我要下降
{\fs60}I'm putting us down.

1091
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,100
好啦...好啦...操！
{\fs60}Okay, okay. Fuck!

1092
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:03,660
这是C-E-I
{\fs60}This is Charlie, Echo, India.

1093
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,780
请求转降卡巴拉机场
{\fs60}Request re-route to Kabala airport,

1094
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,200
方向029
{\fs60}bearing zero-two-nine.

1095
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,120
不...不要降落机场
{\fs60}No, not the airport.

1096
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:11,360
降在高速路上是唯一的希望
{\fs60}There the highway. It's our only hope.

1097
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:12,910
你妈的疯啦
{\fs60}Are you fucking mad?

1098
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:14,660
路上有个坑就完了
{\fs60}A pothole will set us off.

1099
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:16,940
你也太低估自己了，艾利西
{\fs60}You underestimate yourself, Alexei.

1100
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:18,100
你是最棒的
{\fs60}You're the best.

1101
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:21,450
艾利西，妈的，你最棒
{\fs60}You're the shit, Alexei, you're the shit!

1102
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:24,770
艾利西当然不是最好的飞行员
{\fs60}Of course Alexei wasn't the best.

1103
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:26,790
他是莫斯科航校
{\fs60}He'd come forty-second out of forty three

1104
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,400
倒数第二名毕业
{\fs60}at the Moscow Flight School.

1105
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,820
天啊，他在干嘛？
{\fs60}Oh, God, what's he doing?

1106
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:40,160
他疯了吗?
{\fs60}Is this guy nuts?

1107
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:43,800
我不能降落
{\fs60}I can't land there, sir.

1108
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:45,630
卡巴拉离这儿15分钟
{\fs60}Kabala's fifteen minutes away.

1109
01:10:45,650 --> 01:10:46,780
他跑不远的
{\fs60}He can't get far.

1110
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:49,020
叫辆卡车在停机坪待命
{\fs60}I want a truck on the tarmac.

1111
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:06,710
我们会没事的
{\fs60}We gonna be okay.

1112
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:10,310
你们去哪儿？
{\fs60}Where are you going?

1113
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,390
离证据愈远愈好
{\fs60}As far from the evidence as we can get.

1114
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:14,540
等等...证据马上就没了！
{\fs60}Wait, there's not going to be any evidence!

1115
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:31,690

1131
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:15,610
子弹...枪...手榴弹...
{\fs60}Bullets! Guns! Grenades!

1132
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:18,020
好
{\fs60}Yeah.

1133
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:19,880
枪上还刻着你的名字呢
{\fs60}That one's got your name on it.

1134
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:21,390
你也要吗？快来
{\fs60}You want one, too? Come on.

1135
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,620
别忘了子弹哦！
{\fs60}Don't forget the bullets.

1136
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:24,320
别忘了子弹哦！
{\fs60}Don't forget the bullets.

1137
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,840
没子弹的话，枪也没用
{\fs60}How can you shoot a gun if you don't have bullets?

1138
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:29,090
所有的，通通免费
{\fs60}Everything goes for free!

1139
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:33,120
枪，手榴弹！一切你看得见的，子弹
{\fs60}Guns, grenades! All you see. Bullets,

1140
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:35,010
枪，手榴弹！
{\fs60}guns, grenades.

1141
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:36,780
耶！耶！
{\fs60}Hooray, hooray!

1142
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:39,270
快拿子弹
{\fs60}Have the bullets.

1143
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:42,210
机组人员花一整天搬运的货物
{\fs60}What a cargo crew at Heathrow Airport

1144
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:44,980
塞拉利昂的饥民
{\fs60}does in a day took a bunch of

1145
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,460
在十分钟之内就搬光了
{\fs60}malnourished Sierra Leonean locals ten minutes.

1146
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:51,120
当瓦伦丁特工到达时
{\fs60}By the time Agent Valentine got there,

1147
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:53,660
草原上遍地是枪，人人手舞足蹈
{\fs60}you could find more guns on a plane full of Quakers.

1148
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:02,260
我是尤里·奥洛夫
{\fs60}Yuri Orlov.

1149
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:04,560
噢，操！
{\fs60}Ow! Fuck!

1150
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,720
还想逃？
{\fs60}You run from us?

1151
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:07,980
不，恩比西，不要
{\fs60}No, Mbizi. No!

1152
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,200
废了你的双腿看你怎么逃？
{\fs60}Can you run with no legs?

1153
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:12,300
我可以让他消失
{\fs60}Let me make him disappear, Mr Valentine

1154
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,030
这里天天有人失踪
{\fs60}Around here, people disappear all the time.

1155
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,210
我不能那样做
{\fs60}I can't do that.

1156
01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:17,550
荒郊野外...谁会知道？
{\fs60}Look where we are. Who will know?

1157
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,310
起码我们知道
{\fs60}We will.

1158
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:29,990
他会得到报应的
{\fs60}He's gonna get what's coming to him.

1159
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:31,860
这个我不那么肯定
{\fs60}I'm not as certain.

1160
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:41,670
起来
{\fs60}All right, get up.

1161
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:47,450
罪名是？
{\fs60}What's the charge?

1162
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:49,170
你在塞拉利昂干嘛？
{\fs60}What are you doing in Sierra Leone...

1163
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:51,120
狩猎旅行
{\fs60}I'm on safari.

1164
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:54,530
是吗？猎野兽？
{\fs60}Yeah? You're hunting wildebeests

1165
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:55,430
用机关枪？
{\fs60}with a submachine gun?

1166
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,400
你也替公园管理局工作？
{\fs60}Do you also work with the Park Service?

1167
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,870
我的罪名是无照狩猎吗？
{\fs60}Hunting without a license, is that the charge?

1168
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:01,070
装什么傻？
{\fs60}Why are we playing games?

1169
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:03,440
你私运军火
{\fs60}You traffic arms.

1170
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:04,170
是买卖
{\fs60}Trade.

1171
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:05,380
买卖就是私运
{\fs60}Trade. Traffic.

1172
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:10,300
你提供世上最穷的人们
{\fs60}You get rich by giving the poorest people on the planet

1173
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,130
互相屠杀的工具以此致富
{\fs60}the means to continue killing each other.

1174
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,330
你知道我为什么做这个
{\fs60}Do you konw why I do what I do?

1175
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:16,590
我能选择其他更荣耀的任务
{\fs60} I mean, there are more prestigious assignments.

1176
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:18,910
比方追查核武
{\fs60}Keeping track of nuclear arsenals,

1177
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,920
你认为那对世界和平更重要？
{\fs60}You'd think that's more critical to world security,

1178
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:21,770
不对！
{\fs60}but it's not.

1179
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:24,340
今天十个战争受害者中有九人
{\fs60}No, nine out of ten war victims today

1180
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:27,880
是死于攻击性来福枪和小型武器 正如你的商品
{\fs60}are killed with assault rifles and small like yours.

1181
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:28,940
那些核飞弹？
{\fs60}Those nuclear missiles?

1182
01:15:28,970 --> 01:15:30,080
它们还在发射筒里坐着呢
{\fs60}They sit in their silos.

1183
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:34,020
你的AK-47才是大规模杀伤性武器
{\fs60}Your AK-47? That is the real weapon of mass destruction.

1184
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,830
瓦伦丁特工，我不想害死人
{\fs60}I don't want people dead, Agent Valentine.

1185
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:40,080
我没拿枪指着别人的脑袋要他开枪
{\fs60}I don't put a gun to anybody's head and make them shoot.

1186
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:43,540
我是说，他开一枪，对我的生意有好处
{\fs60}I admit, but shooting war is better for business,

1187
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,660
但我希望人们使用我的枪但不打死人
{\fs60}but I prefer people to fire my guns and miss.

1188
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:47,310
只要他们开枪就行
{\fs60}Just as long as they're firing.

1189
01:15:57,050 --> 01:15:58,150
我能走了吗？
{\fs60}Can I go now?

1190
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:02,140
我身上没有你想要的 除了手铐之外
{\fs60}You've got nothing on me. Except cuffs.

1191
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:07,560
既然你要讲法
{\fs60}Since you're so concerned with the law,

1192
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:10,340
那你一定知道
{\fs60}you must know that I'm legally

1193
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:12,940
我能合法的拘留你24小时而不起诉你
{\fs60}permitted to hold you for twenty-four hours without charging you.

1194
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:16,360
或许你会问，我为什么要这么做
{\fs60}You might ask why I would do that and I can assure you.

1195
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:18,680
我保证不是因为我喜欢你陪我
{\fs60}It's not because I enjoy your company, because I don't.

1196
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:22,570
原因是在许可的24小时内
{\fs60}No, the reason why I'll delay you for every second

1197
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:24,480
我要居留你每一秒钟
{\fs60}of the permissible twenty-four hours

1198
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:28,630
我就拖延了你的致命武器去杀人
{\fs60}Is I'm delaying your deadly trade and the deaths of your victims.

1199
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,730
我不认为我拿了你一天
{\fs60}I don't think of it as taking a day from you...

1200
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:32,460
而是多给他们一天
{\fs60}...but giving a day to them.

1201
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:34,870
因为你不自由
{\fs60}Some innocent man, woman, or child

1202
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:38,630
所以世上那些无辜的平民才能多活一天
{\fs60} is going to have an extra day on this earth because you're not free.

1203
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:45,620
所以...23小时55分钟后...
{\fs60}So, I will see you in twenty-three hours

1204
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:47,640
我会再来
{\fs60}and fifty-five minutes, hm?

1205
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:55,680
瓦伦丁知道他不必守着我
{\fs60}Valentine knew he didn't have to guard me.

1206
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:57,150
我也没地方可逃
{\fs60}There was nowhere to go.

1207
01:16:58,230 --> 01:17:01,130
或许他希望当地人会把我分尸
{\fs60}Or maybe he was hoping the locals would tear me apart.

1208
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:04,170
但他们忙着玩我的飞机
{\fs60}But they were too busy with the plane.

1209
01:17:06,650 --> 01:17:09,860
就像停了一辆好车在纽约布朗区
{\fs60}It's like parking your car in certain neighborhoods in the Bronx.

1210
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:11,880
你绝对不会这么做
{\fs60}You just don't do it.

1211
01:17:23,710 --> 01:17:25,060
以我的观点来看
{\fs60}The way I looked at it

1212
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:28,190
这只是非洲的自然现象 或是生命的自然现象
{\fs60}it's the way of Africa, maybe life.

1213
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,970
所有从自然来的东西最后终将回归自然
{\fs60}Everything that comes from the earth eventually returns.

1214
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:35,690
即使40吨的安通纳12型货机也一样
{\fs60}Even a 40-ton Atonov-12 cargo plane.

1215
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:36,220
我的礼物，给你
{\fs60}A gift. For you.

1216
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:40,220
还好你及时到了
{\fs60}You know, you've arrived just in time.

1217
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:42,740
我担心他在你来之前就死了
{\fs60}I was afraid that he might die

1218
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:46,810
你就没机会了宰了他
{\fs60}before you got your chance to kill him.

1219
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:58,800
这个人...来此...想取代你
{\fs60}This man came here hoping to take your place.

1220
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:03,030
我说的对吧？
{\fs60}Is that not so?

1221
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,670
不，我不是来为巴提斯先生提供武器的
{\fs60}No, I'm not here to supply Mr. Baptiste.

1222
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:22,120
我是来给他的敌人提供武器的
{\fs60}I am here to supply his enemies.

1223
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:28,230
我想这笔交易我已经无法完成了
{\fs60}I fear it's a sale I shall never complete.

1224
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:35,300
他杀了你一个亲人...你叔叔...
{\fs60}He killed your blood... Your uncle...

1225
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:38,370
他本来想杀你的
{\fs60}when he tried to kill you.

1226
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:48,290
不要
{\fs60}No.

1227
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:49,760
不要？
{\fs60}No?

1228
01:19:52,650 --> 01:19:54,430
你要我就放了他？
{\fs60}You want that I should let him go?

1229
01:19:57,170 --> 01:19:59,580
“不，我...”
{\fs60}"No. I..."

1230
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:04,420
你的确想要他死
{\fs60}You do want him dead.

1231
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:06,450
只是...
{\fs60}You just...

1232
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,630
不想亲自动手
{\fs60}don't want to have to do it yourself.

1233
01:20:16,030 --> 01:20:16,920
好
{\fs60}So.

1234
01:20:19,010 --> 01:20:20,330
我们一起来
{\fs60}We will do this together.

1235
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:31,660
这将是我们结合的经验
{\fs60}This will be a bonding experience.

1236
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:39,620
你知道，只要你想，随时可以住手
{\fs60}You know you can stop this any time that you want.

1237
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:42,120
但我不认为你想
{\fs60}But I don't think that you do.

1238
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:43,960
一句话就好
{\fs60}Just say the word.

1239
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:48,670
说吧...“住手”
{\fs60}Say it. "Stop."

1240
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:03,580
住手
{\fs60}Stop.

1241
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,700
朋友，我替你另开个房间
{\fs60}I will get you another room, my friend.

1242
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:19,060
风景更好些的
{\fs60}With a much nicer view.

1243
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,500
他帮你要了布朗-布朗，尤里先生
{\fs60}He ordered you brown-brown, Mr. Yuri.

1244
01:21:58,560 --> 01:21:59,090
什么？
{\fs60}What?

1245
01:21:59,830 --> 01:22:00,700
布朗-布朗
{\fs60}Brown-brown.

1246
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:01,640
那是什么？
{\fs60}What is it?

1247
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:03,770
海洛因
{\fs60}A mixture of cocaine...

1248
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:06,330
和火药的混合体
{\fs60}...and gunpowder.

1249
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:10,100
他们把它在战斗前给那些孩子们吸食
{\fs60}They give it to the young boys before they do battle.

1250
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:11,060
吸过后他们会做任何事
{\fs60}They'll do anything!

1251
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:14,710
下次再试吧
{\fs60}Some other time.

1252
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:18,900
我劝你还是试一下，尤里先生
{\fs60}I suggest you try it, at least once, Mr. Yuri.

1253
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:20,600
为什么？
{\fs60}Why?

1254
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:23,800
因为这是你的火药
{\fs60}'Cause it's your gunpowder.

1255
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,910
在那晚之前
{\fs60}Even before that night,

1256
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:50,720
我在西非已经用过很多次毒品了
{\fs60}I'd started doing a lot of cocaine in West Africa.

1257
01:22:51,070 --> 01:22:53,380
我从来没试过布朗-布朗
{\fs60}I'd never tried brown-brown before,

1258
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:55,670
就像我从来没有杀过一个人一样
{\fs60}but then I'd never killed a man, either.

1259
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:14,470
哦
{\fs60}Oh.

1260
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:23,040
我没做过什么吧？
{\fs60}Oh, I didn't do anything, did I?

1261
01:23:24,770 --> 01:23:26,350
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(970,898)}我没做过什么吧？

1262
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:28,520
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(958,898)}你做的不是很多

1263
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:31,900
你有病吗？
{\fs60}Wait. Are you sick?

1264
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:35,040
艾滋病？
{\fs60}SIDA? AIDS?

1265
01:23:36,910 --> 01:23:39,610
问一问这个白人，他会知道答案的
{\fs60}Ask the white man. He will know.

1266
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:42,490
先生，我的手会长回来吗？
{\fs60}Sir, will my hand grow back?

1267
01:23:51,210 --> 01:23:52,420
萨米昂？
{\fs60}Simeon.

1268
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:55,930
记住，尤里，立场
{\fs60}Remember, Yuri, take sides.

1269
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:00,460
萨米昂
{\fs60}Simeon!

1270
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:06,810
他是安德烈的人 - 去他的安德烈
{\fs60}Don't! He's Andre's.  - Fuck Andre!

1271
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:08,650
去他的安德烈
{\fs60}Fuck Andre!

1272
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,770
对不起，这些枪平时不是这样的
{\fs60}I'm sorry they don't usually do that.

1273
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:18,620
让我看一看，我也许可以把它修好
{\fs60}Let me look it. Maybe I can fix it.

1274
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,220
让我看一看，是弹夹的问题
{\fs60}Let me see it. It's the magazine.

1275
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:20,950
给我看看
{\fs60}Give it to me.

1276
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:24,230
去你的
{\fs60}Fuck you!

1277
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:52,520
我开始觉得我被诅咒了
{\fs60}I started to feel I'd been cursed.

1278
01:24:53,310 --> 01:24:55,250
不死的诅咒
{\fs60}...the curse of invincibility.

1279
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,760
尼奇，回到你的房间去
{\fs60}Nicki, please, go to your room.

1280
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,760
我不相信你
{\fs60}I don't believe you.

1281
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:09,360
你能证明这些吗？
{\fs60}Can you prove any of this?

1282
01:25:11,150 --> 01:25:13,940
奥洛夫先生花了很长时间
{\fs60}Mr. Orlov goes to a lot of trouble

1283
01:25:13,970 --> 01:25:15,820
才使他的公司看起来像是做正当生意的
{\fs60}to make his business look legitimate.

1284
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:17,220
即使是对你
{\fs60}Even to you.

1285
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:19,210
特别是对你
{\fs60}Perhaps especially to you.

1286
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:22,600
我想我们今天在这里什么也不会发现
{\fs60}I don't expect we'll find anything here today.

1287
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:24,180
你到底想要什么？
{\fs60}So what do you want?

1288
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:28,520
我希望你可以帮助我
{\fs60}I was hoping that you would help me.

1289
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:37,980
我了解...
{\fs60}I understand that uh...

1290
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:41,520
你的父母的死很悲惨
{\fs60}your parents died tragically?

1291
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:48,920
杀死你父母的枪械
{\fs60}The illegal firearms used to murder your mother and father

1292
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:52,240
是从像你丈夫那样的人那里来得
{\fs60}were procured from men exactly like your husband.

1293
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:56,360
我想你离开这里
{\fs60}I'd like you to leave.

1294
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,020
好的，先生们
{\fs60}Okay. Gentlemen.

1295
01:26:17,490 --> 01:26:18,510
艾娃？
{\fs60}Ava?

1296
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:29,550
艾娃，你怎么了？
{\fs60}Ava, what's wrong?

1297
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:32,850
我不能穿这些衣服
{\fs60}I can't wear the clothes.

1298
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:35,580
我不能戴这些首饰
{\fs60}Can't wear the jewelry.

1299
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:39,010
我不能开车
{\fs60}Can't drive the car.

1300
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:43,170
我不能住在这间房子里
{\fs60}Can't live in this house.

1301
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,680
所有的东西都沾满了鲜血
{\fs60}Everything's got blood on it.

1302
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:46,860
沾满了鲜血？
{\fs60}Blood on it?

1303
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,000
你到底怎么了？
{\fs60}What's the matter with you?

1304
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:56,850
不要这么闹情绪
{\fs60}Don't be so melodramatic.

1305
01:26:57,220 --> 01:26:58,700
我没不是在闹情绪
{\fs60}I'm melodramatic.

1306
01:26:58,710 --> 01:27:00,700
我是个失败的演员，记得吗?
{\fs60}I'm a failed actress, remember?

1307
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:12,390
我告诉过你这些人有政治目的
{\fs60}I told you, these people, it's political.

1308
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:14,460
他们在说谎，他们是说谎的人
{\fs60}They lie. They're liars.

1309
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:17,860
看着我，他们用谎言来美化自己，知道吗?
{\fs60}Look at me. They lie to make themselves look good, okay?

1310
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,700
你不能相信他们
{\fs60}You can't trust them.

1311
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:20,970
不只是他们
{\fs60}It's not just them.

1312
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,280
不用担心，你的家人什么也没说
{\fs60}Don't worry. Your family didn't say anything.

1313
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:28,970
他们不需要这么做
{\fs60}They didn't have to.

1314
01:27:31,470 --> 01:27:36,000
我卖给这些人力量去保护他们自己，艾娃
{\fs60}I sell people a means to defend themselves. Ava.

1315
01:27:36,110 --> 01:27:36,920
我只做这些
{\fs60}That's all.

1316
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:40,570
尤里，我看过新闻，我看过那些照片
{\fs60}Yuri, I see the news. I see those pictures.

1317
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:42,590
那些枪比孩子们还要高!
{\fs60}The guns are bigger than the boys!

1318
01:27:42,610 --> 01:27:45,180
我做的事没有一点是不合法的!
{\fs60}There is nothing illegal about what I do!

1319
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:46,790
我才不管它是否合法!
{\fs60}I don't care if it's legal!

1320
01:27:47,790 --> 01:27:49,050
那是不对的!
{\fs60}It's wrong!

1321
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:10,900
求求你，收手吧
{\fs60}Please, stop.

1322
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,940
我干或不干已经没有区别了
{\fs60}It makes no difference if I stop.

1323
01:28:16,970 --> 01:28:18,990
第二天，就会有人接替我的位置
{\fs60}Someone will take my place the next day.

1324
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:22,280
让他们去干吧，我们已经有足够的钱了
{\fs60}So let them. We have enough.

1325
01:28:23,630 --> 01:28:25,240
这并不是关于钱
{\fs60}It's not about the money.

1326
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:28,430
那是关于什么？
{\fs60}Then what is it?

1327
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:34,350
我干这个很拿手
{\fs60}I'm good at it.

1328
01:28:45,410 --> 01:28:48,270
我觉得我一生唯一所做的事就是长的漂亮
{\fs60}I feel like all I've done my whole life is be pretty.

1329
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:53,710
我的出世就已经成就了现在的我
{\fs60}I mean all I've done is be born.

1330
01:28:55,050 --> 01:28:58,930
我是一个失败的演员，失败的艺术家
{\fs60}I'm a failed actress, a failed artist.

1331
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,060
失败的妈妈
{\fs60}I'm not much good as a mother.

1332
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:06,520
我有时觉得自己甚至已不再美丽了
{\fs60}I'm not even that pretty anymore.

1333
01:29:10,310 --> 01:29:14,020
我什么事都已经失败了，尤里
{\fs60}I have failed at everything, Yuri.

1334
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:18,360
但我不能做一个失败的人
{\fs60}But I won't fail as a human being.

1335
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:26,340
我的敌人终于找到了一种可以伤害我的武器
{\fs60}that could hurt me. My enemies had finally found a weapon

1336
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:29,860
在接下来的6个月了
{\fs60}For the next six months,

1337
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:31,000
我不再走私枪支了
{\fs60}I stopped running guns.

1338
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:32,210
我开始做正当生意
{\fs60}I went legitimate.

1339
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:33,370
这是一个不可限量的市场
{\fs60}This is an untapped market.

1340
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:37,620
我们在说5百万平方米的森林 仅仅是第一年
{\fs60}I'm talking over five million cubic meters of timber in the first year alone.

1341
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:39,560
超过100种可以开发的种类
{\fs60}Over 100 exploitable species.

1342
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:40,980
石油?
{\fs60}The oil?

1343
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:42,580
只是在你和我之间
{\fs60}Between you and me, this...

1344
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:45,160
1万桶一个月
{\fs60}Ten thousand barrels a month?

1345
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:49,280
他一定是在说谎，他在说谎!
{\fs60}He must be lying. He's talking!

1346
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:53,050
这有一些石油储备石油输出国组织根本不知道
{\fs60}Listen, there are gas reserves off the lvory Coast that OPEC doesn't even know about.

1347
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:54,830
这些电话号码已经都检查过了
{\fs60}The phone numbers all check out.

1348
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:58,360
都是合法的
{\fs60}It's all on the level.

1349
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:02,140
怪不得瓦伦丁会困惑了
{\fs60}No wonder Valentine was confused.

1350
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:17,940
感谢上帝
{\fs60}Thank God there are still legal ways

1351
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:19,830
还是有一些合法渠道可以和发展中国家交易
{\fs60}to exploit developing countries.

1352
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:22,440
但是合法的钱
{\fs60}The only problem with an honest buck

1353
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,060
真是难赚
{\fs60}is they're so hard to make.

1354
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,840
很多人都在干
{\fs60}The margins are too low.

1355
01:30:25,910 --> 01:30:27,550
利润实在太低了
{\fs60}Too many people are doing it.

1356
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:34,860
但是我已经答应了艾娃
{\fs60}Still, I'd promised Ava.

1357
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:46,730
尤里，利比里亚的总统正在来这里的路
{\fs60}Yuri, the President of Liberia is on his way up.

1358
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:50,130
他早到了
{\fs60}He's early.

1359
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:52,660
我一会就回来
{\fs60}I'll be back in a minute.

1360
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:02,060
你来这做什么，安德烈?
{\fs60}What the fuck are you doing here, Andre?

1361
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:04,300
我到联合国来签和平条约
{\fs60}We are here for peace talks at the United Nations.

1362
01:31:04,310 --> 01:31:06,690
所以你决定顺便来问候你的军火商?
{\fs60}So at the same time you thought you'd drop in on your arms dealer?

1363
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:09,930
我只是奇怪那还是你的职业吗?
{\fs60}Well, I was beginning to wonder whether that was still your profession.

1364
01:31:10,350 --> 01:31:12,880
你要知道你这个人并不好找
{\fs60}You know, you're a hard man to get a hold of all of Sudden.

1365
01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:14,690
太可惜了
{\fs60}That is a shame.

1366
01:31:15,410 --> 01:31:18,870
我儿子和我准备在纽约
{\fs60}My son and I were hoping to do a little shopping.

1367
01:31:19,170 --> 01:31:20,530
顺道购物一番
{\fs60}While in New York.

1368
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:21,740
他们在监视你，你知道吗？
{\fs60}You know they're watching you.

1369
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:23,560
是的，我知道
{\fs60}Yes, I know they blame me.

1370
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:25,940
他们什么事都要怪在我头上 那些伪君子!
{\fs60}They blame me for everything, those hypocrites.

1371
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:27,780
他们在找一个巫师(政治迫害的错误语法)
{\fs60}There're hunt for a witch.

1372
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:27,780
{\an7\fs70\bord0\shad2}巫师（witch hunt)：政治迫害的错误语法)

1373
01:31:27,950 --> 01:31:28,930
是政治迫害
{\fs60}Witch hunt.

1374
01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:31,140
冲突已经升级了
{\fs60}Hostilities have escalated.

1375
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:34,630
我无法得到我想要的资源
{\fs60}And they are making it very difficult for me to re-supply.

1376
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:40,360
这需要一个像你这样的人来协调
{\fs60}That requires a man of your rare ingenuity.

1377
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:44,510
对不起，我无法帮助你
{\fs60}I can't help you, I'm sorry.

1378
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:52,760
我理解
{\fs60}I understand.

1379
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:56,470
但是你应该知道这些:
{\fs60}But you should know this:

1380
01:31:56,850 --> 01:31:58,530
在目前的情况下
{\fs60}Due to our present situation

1381
01:31:58,550 --> 01:32:02,320
我们愿意付出任何代价
{\fs60}we are compelled to be unusually generous.

1382
01:32:07,530 --> 01:32:11,620
希望很快见到你，战争之王
{\fs60}So, see you soon, Lord of War.

1383
01:32:15,510 --> 01:32:18,630
你还没有给我兰博之枪
{\fs60}You still haven't brought me the gun of Rambo.

1384
01:32:35,330 --> 01:32:37,110
一个四个半月大的胎儿
{\fs60}At four and a half months old...

1385
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:40,050
可以看到尾骨
{\fs60}a human fetus has a reptile's tail...

1386
01:32:40,190 --> 01:32:42,140
这就是进化的证明
{\fs60}a remnant of our evolution.

1387
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:44,340
也许那就是我无法停止的原因
{\fs60}Maybe that's what I couldn't escape.

1388
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:46,820
你可以和许多敌人战斗过 仍然存活下来
{\fs60}You can fight a lot of enemies and survive,

1389
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,750
但是如果你和你自己战斗
{\fs60}but if you fight your biology,

1390
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:50,130
你总是会输
{\fs60}you always lose.

1391
01:32:50,170 --> 01:32:51,760
你们不要和我说再见吗？
{\fs60}You guys aren't waiting to say goodbye?

1392
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,080
我还要10分钟才离开这里
{\fs60}I'm not leaving for another ten minutes.

1393
01:32:53,090 --> 01:32:55,280
对不起，尼奇要去上游泳课了
{\fs60}Sorry, Nicki has swim practice.

1394
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:58,240
我知道你要出差，我觉的很高兴
{\fs60}You know, I'm kind of glad you're going.

1395
01:32:58,290 --> 01:33:01,140
你在这里呆的太久 我开始有些担心了
{\fs60}You've been here so long you're starting to get on my nerves.

1396
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:03,530
这个石油项目会在周四结束
{\fs60}This oil concession should be wrapped up by Thursday.

1397
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:04,660
周末我就会回来
{\fs60}I'll be back for the weekend.

1398
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:05,730
我们一家人出去聚一聚
{\fs60}We'll go somewhere.

1399
01:33:05,790 --> 01:33:06,750
去海边
{\fs60}The sea.

1400
01:33:06,860 --> 01:33:08,080
那太好了
{\fs60}That would be fun.

1401
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:09,920
好
{\fs60}Come on.

1402
01:33:09,950 --> 01:33:12,980
你相信我，对吗？
{\fs60}Hey. You trust me, right?

1403
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:17,050
她看着我的眼神
{\fs60}She looked me directly in the eye...

1404
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:19,780
就像我看着上千名海关人员，政府官员
{\fs60}the way I've looked in the eyes of a thousand customs officials...

1405
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,370
和其他执法官员的眼神一样
{\fs60}government bureaucrats and law enforcement agents.

1406
01:33:22,410 --> 01:33:24,700
是的，我相信你
{\fs60}Yes, I trust you.

1407
01:33:24,730 --> 01:33:26,810
她就这样向我撒了慌
{\fs60}And she lied without flinching.

1408
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:28,180
再见，宝贝
{\fs60}I'll see you, big guy.

1409
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:30,330
再见，爸爸
{\fs60}Bye Papa.

1410
01:33:31,050 --> 01:33:32,740
她从最好的人那里学到了这些
{\fs60}She learned from the best.

1411
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:33,700
祝你旅行愉快
{\fs60}Have a good trip.

1412
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:52,160
那就是他
{\fs60}That's him.

1413
01:34:13,030 --> 01:34:14,950
我们要去哪里，妈妈？
{\fs60}Where are we going, Mama?

1414
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,150
这是一个游戏，亲爱的
{\fs60}It's a game, honey.

1415
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:17,840
像捉迷藏一样吗？
{\fs60}Like hide and seek?

1416
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:19,580
是的
{\fs60}Yes.

1417
01:34:21,290 --> 01:34:22,650
像捉迷藏一样
{\fs60}Like hide and seek.

1418
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:45,950
如果我被跟踪了，我总是会感觉到
{\fs60}I can always sense when I'm being tailed.

1419
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,560
我知道怎样找到被跟踪的迹像
{\fs60}I know what to look for.

1420
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:50,310
但是我从来没有被我爱的女人跟踪过
{\fs60}But then I'd never been tailed by the woman I love.

1421
01:35:03,210 --> 01:35:05,510
我可以了解她在想什么
{\fs60}I can put myself in Ava's place.

1422
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:10,120
她猜到密码也许是我的社安号的最后4位
{\fs60}She might've understood if the combination was the last four digits of my social security number...

1423
01:35:10,130 --> 01:35:11,670
我的生日，或者是她的生日
{\fs60}my birth date, even her birth date,

1424
01:35:11,690 --> 01:35:12,900
但是她不会猜到是尼克的生日
{\fs60}but not Nicolai's.

1425
01:35:29,310 --> 01:35:30,930
我儿子的生日打开了它
{\fs60}My son's birthday unlocked

1426
01:35:30,950 --> 01:35:34,240
政府后来称它为"武器大全"
{\fs60}what the government would later describe as "a catalogue of carnage."

1427
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:46,240
你要呆在这里
{\fs60}Nicki, stay right there.

1428
01:36:49,820 --> 01:36:50,750
我们走，尼克
{\fs60}Come on, Nicki.

1429
01:37:04,180 --> 01:37:05,940
来看我们怎么赔钱吗？
{\fs60}Come to see how the other half lives?

1430
01:37:06,010 --> 01:37:07,410
我想念你做的菜
{\fs60}I miss your borscht.

1431
01:37:07,910 --> 01:37:09,460
爸爸妈妈告诉我你成功戒毒了
{\fs60}Mom and Dad say you're clean.

1432
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:10,420
是的，你不也是吗
{\fs60}Yeah, you, too.

1433
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:13,530
你开始做正当生意了?
{\fs60}You went legit, huh?

1434
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:15,550
真是不敢相信
{\fs60}That's hard to believe.

1435
01:37:15,870 --> 01:37:17,420
那是因为那不是真的
{\fs60}That's because it's not true.

1436
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:20,930
只有你知道
{\fs60}Only you know.

1437
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,530
我今晚要离开，有生意要做
{\fs60}I'm leaving tonight on a job

1438
01:37:22,710 --> 01:37:24,000
我想让你和我一起去
{\fs60}I want you to come.

1439
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:30,320
我不能去，我有了女朋友
{\fs60}I can't. I've got a girlfriend.

1440
01:37:30,990 --> 01:37:32,670
我想她就是我想要结婚的人
{\fs60}I think she might be the one.

1441
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:35,570
而且我想自己开一家餐馆
{\fs60}Plus, I'm thinking of opening my own place.

1442
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:37,590
这次的生意也许可以帮助你
{\fs60}Maybe this trip will help.

1443
01:37:38,050 --> 01:37:39,110
可以赚很多钱
{\fs60}It's good money.

1444
01:37:41,950 --> 01:37:46,120
尤里，我已经同他们发誓不再干了
{\fs60}Yuri, I've given my word.

1445
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:47,590
没有人会知道
{\fs60}No one has to know.

1446
01:37:48,050 --> 01:37:50,090
我告诉他们我们去做石油生意
{\fs60}Tell them we going for a little R and R.

1447
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:55,170
为什么你突然开始需要我了?
{\fs60}What do you need me for, all of sudden?

1448
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:57,190
西非现在很混乱
{\fs60}West Africa's fucked up.

1449
01:37:57,810 --> 01:37:59,100
不同往日的
{\fs60}More than usual.

1450
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:01,830
我没有任何人可以相信
{\fs60}I can't trust anybody.

1451
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:06,860
我需要你保护我
{\fs60}I need you to watch my back.

1452
01:38:10,030 --> 01:38:12,240
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(936,900.7)}兄弟心连心

1453
01:38:23,290 --> 01:38:26,210
{\bord0\shad4\fad(400,300)\fs75\pos(444,906.1)}利比里亚首都，蒙罗维亚 - 2001

1454
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:50,430
尤里!欢迎你回来
{\fs60}Yuri! Welcome back.

1455
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:53,630
欢迎你们两个人
{\fs60}Welcome both of you.

1456
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:56,040
欢迎来到民主国家
{\fs60}Welcome to democracy.

1457
01:38:56,110 --> 01:38:57,210
民主国家？
{\fs60}Democracy?

1458
01:38:57,240 --> 01:38:58,730
你最近到底喝了什么？安迪
{\fs60}What have you been drinking, Andy?

1459
01:38:58,820 --> 01:39:00,550
你看新闻了吗?
{\fs60}Huh, you have not seen the news.

1460
01:39:00,740 --> 01:39:02,880
他们控告我非法操纵大选
{\fs60}You know they accuse me of rigging elections.

1461
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:07,700
但是在你们最高法院 对于佛罗里达的事作出最后判决后
{\fs60}But after this, with your Florida and you Supreme Court of Kangaroos,

1462
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:11,010
美国要永远的闭嘴了
{\fs60}Now, the U.S. Must shut up forever.

1463
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:16,960
你是怎么办到的，尤里?
{\fs60}How do you do this, Yuri?

1464
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:20,480
你是如何
{\fs60}How do you do this,

1465
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:23,240
在他们监视着我领空的条件下办到的?
{\fs60}when they are watching all of my airspace?

1466
01:39:23,710 --> 01:39:25,370
哪里有需求，哪里就会有武器
{\fs60}Where there's a will, there's a weapon.

1467
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:28,680
快点，我的钱在哪？
{\fs60}Come on, where's my fucking money?

1468
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:34,830
你把货送到后，你就会收到钱
{\fs60}When it is delivered.

1469
01:39:36,990 --> 01:39:38,100
货已经送到了
{\fs60}It is delivered.

1470
01:39:38,150 --> 01:39:39,370
这些货不是给我的
{\fs60}This is not for me.

1471
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,950
它是给我西面的邻居的
{\fs60}This is for my neighbors to the west.

1472
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:43,300
西边?
{\fs60}The west?

1473
01:39:44,910 --> 01:39:46,410
我们要去塞拉利昂
{\fs60}We're going to Sierra Leone.

1474
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:50,150
没错，我的儿子安德烈二世
{\fs60}Oh, yes. And my son Baptiste Junior

1475
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:52,330
会和你们一起去帮你们作介绍
{\fs60}will go with you to make the proper introductions.

1476
01:39:53,290 --> 01:39:54,820
我们没有卡车
{\fs60}We have no trucks.

1477
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:56,500
你们会有的
{\fs60}You will.

1478
01:39:56,630 --> 01:40:00,110
我们运完食物后，你们就有卡车了
{\fs60}As soon as we get the food out of them.

1479
01:40:04,910 --> 01:40:06,160
兰博之枪
{\fs60}Gun of Rambo.

1480
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,230
尤里先生，你很守信用
{\fs60}Mr. Yuri, you're a man of your word.

1481
01:40:10,430 --> 01:40:11,930
我们去哪里？
{\fs60}So where are we going?

1482
01:40:12,150 --> 01:40:15,610
RUF，自由战士
{\fs60}RUF -the Freedom Fighters.

1483
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:20,440
每一个在非洲的派系 喜欢给自己起一些高尚的名字
{\fs60}Every faction in Africa calls themselves by the noble names.

1484
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:22,520
解放这个，爱国那个
{\fs60}Liberation-this Patriotic-that,

1485
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:24,570
或者共和或民主什么的
{\fs60}Democratic Republic of-something-or-other.

1486
01:40:28,470 --> 01:40:31,030
也许他们不知道自己是什么
{\fs60}I guess they can't own up to what they usually are

1487
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:34,660
地球唯一喜欢战争的民族
{\fs60}Federation of Worse Oppressors than the Last Bunch of Oppressors.

1488
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:43,520
往往最残忍的暴行
{\fs60}Often, the most barbaric atrocities occur

1489
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:47,040
都出自声称自己为自由战士的人们
{\fs60}when both combatants proclaim themselves "freedom fighters."

1490
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:57,200
好的，我有500支枪，全新的
{\fs60}Right, I've got 500 units, brand new right out of the box,

1491
01:40:57,210 --> 01:40:59,460
刚刚从箱子里拿出来，都和这支一样新
{\fs60}all as clean as this. What have you got?

1492
01:41:17,430 --> 01:41:19,670
上帝啊
{\fs60}God! Oh, Jesus.

1493
01:41:23,890 --> 01:41:25,040
上帝啊
{\fs60}God! Oh, Jesus.

1494
01:41:28,810 --> 01:41:31,070
尤里，我要和你谈一谈
{\fs60}Yuri, I need to talk to you.

1495
01:41:31,090 --> 01:41:32,060
现在不可以
{\fs60}Not now.

1496
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:33,220
现在就要
{\fs60}Now.

1497
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:36,300
对不起，失陪一下
{\fs60}Excuse me.

1498
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:45,140
怎么了?
{\fs60}What?

1499
01:41:46,650 --> 01:41:48,170
我们不能做这笔交易!
{\fs60}We can't do this deal.

1500
01:41:48,250 --> 01:41:49,970
你到底怎么了？
{\fs60}The fuck we can't! What's the matter with you?

1501
01:41:49,990 --> 01:41:52,560
看那边
{\fs60}Look, over there.

1502
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:55,290
当我们把枪交给他们的时候 那些人就会被杀!
{\fs60}As soon as we hand over the guns those people are going to die!

1503
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:59,660
那不关我们的事
{\fs60}It's not our business.

1504
01:42:00,980 --> 01:42:03,210
他们刚刚杀了一个和尼克相同年纪的小孩
{\fs60}They killed a boy just now as young as Nicki.

1505
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:08,940
有什么问题吗？
{\fs60}What is the holdup?

1506
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:10,550
没有问题
{\fs60}There is no holdup.

1507
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:11,870
我马上就过去
{\fs60}I'll be right there.

1508
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:14,000
维塔利，我们一直知道这个事实
{\fs60}Vitaly, it's what we always know:

1509
01:42:14,010 --> 01:42:15,750
我们不能控制他们要干什么
{\fs60}We can't control what they do.

1510
01:42:15,860 --> 01:42:18,440
不，尤里，今天我们可以
{\fs60}No, no, today we can. Today we can.

1511
01:42:18,450 --> 01:42:19,880
他们就在那里!
{\fs60}Yuri, they're right there!

1512
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:21,740
如果我们真这么做的话
{\fs60}What do you think they'll do to us if we back out?

1513
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:23,190
他们会杀了我们
{\fs60}They'll kill us.

1514
01:42:23,210 --> 01:42:25,500
但是我们继续 你知道他们会怎样对这些人吗？
{\fs60}And if we go ahead, what do you think they'll do to them?

1515
01:42:30,710 --> 01:42:32,220
我们要做些事帮助他们
{\fs60}We've got to do something.

1516
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:35,250
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(936,900.7)}求你了，看在上帝的份上

1517
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:36,880
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(950,900.7)}这不是我们的战争

1518
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:39,380
{\bord0\shad4\fs75\pos(936,900.7)}求你了，兄弟心连心

1519
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:42,200
他在说什么？
{\fs60}What is he saying?

1520
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:44,740
是交易
{\fs60}It's the deal.

1521
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:46,440
我的弟弟对交易的一些细节不满
{\fs60}My brother's not happy with the terms.

1522
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:48,480
我们在讨论这个问题，没事的
{\fs60}We'll work it out. It's nothing.

1523
01:42:56,810 --> 01:42:58,850
对不对，没事的
{\fs60}Right? It's nothing.

1524
01:43:07,330 --> 01:43:08,410
没事的
{\fs60}Yeah. Nothing.

1525
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:11,850
尤里，你说的没错
{\fs60}You're right. Yuri, you're right.

1526
01:43:13,290 --> 01:43:15,700
上帝啊，我脑子一定出问题了
{\fs60}God, I've got to get my shit together.

1527
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,500
这不是我们的战争
{\fs60}This is not our fight.

1528
01:43:18,530 --> 01:43:19,440
没错
{\fs60}Right.

1529
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:21,440
交易内容是什么来着？
{\fs60}Okay. What's the deal?

1530
01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:26,800
300支肩抗式火箭筒 500支步枪，800枚手榴弹
{\fs60}300 RPGs, 500 assault rifles and 800 grenades.

1531
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:31,540
我以为是1200枚手榴弹
{\fs60}I thought it was 1200 grenades.

1532
01:43:34,630 --> 01:43:36,340
我太重视这次交易了
{\fs60}I was so caught up in the deal...

1533
01:43:36,370 --> 01:43:39,080
我没有仔细思考过维塔利的脑子里到底在想什么
{\fs60}I never realized what was going on in Vitaly's head.

1534
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:40,880
我以为是1200枚手榴弹
{\fs60}I thought it was 1200 grenades.

1535
01:43:41,910 --> 01:43:42,900
我记错了
{\fs60}Confused.

1536
01:43:42,950 --> 01:43:43,880
再回头想想
{\fs60}Come to think about it,

1537
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:46,630
也许我永远也不会知道他脑子里在想什么
{\fs60}maybe I never understood what was going on in his head.

1538
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:52,380
对不起
{\fs60}I beg your pardon.

1539
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:54,260
我可以看一看另一颗钻石吗？
{\fs60}May I see another stone?

1540
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:56,820
有一点我很确定
{\fs60}One thing I do understand for certain...

1541
01:43:57,340 --> 01:44:00,280
就是维塔利打破了走私枪支最重要的规则
{\fs60}is that Vitaly broke the cardinal rule of gunrunning.

1542
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:03,780
永远不要拿起一支枪 变成和你客户一样的人
{\fs60}Never pick up a gun and join the customers.

1543
01:44:10,820 --> 01:44:12,190
你在干什么？
{\fs60}What are you doing?

1544
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:17,630
为尤里做一些事
{\fs60}Something for Yuri.

1545
01:44:18,980 --> 01:44:21,550
放下它，慢慢的
{\fs60}Step away. Slow.

1546
01:44:39,830 --> 01:44:41,740
不要，维塔利
{\fs60}No, Vit!

1547
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:44,940
不要，维塔利
{\fs60}No! Vit!

1548
01:46:11,150 --> 01:46:13,020
只有一半的枪支被炸毁了
{\fs60}Only half the guns were gone...

1549
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:15,590
所以我依然得到了一半的钻石
{\fs60}so I was still entitled to half the diamonds.

1550
01:46:16,350 --> 01:46:18,340
如果我拿了它们，我失去了一些东西
{\fs60}If I took them, I was lost.

1551
01:46:18,660 --> 01:46:20,780
如果我不拿它们，我也是失去了一些东西
{\fs60}If I left them, I was lost.

1552
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:32,410
一场大屠杀发生了，就像维塔利所说的那样
{\fs60}The massacre played out exactly how Vitaly predicted.

1553
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:34,510
另外，那一周在塞拉利昂
{\fs60}But then, a half-dozen other massacres

1554
01:46:34,540 --> 01:46:36,810
还发生了许多大屠杀
{\fs60}happened in Sierra Leone that week.

1555
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:38,660
你不可能制止所有的大屠杀
{\fs60}You can't stop them all.

1556
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:41,530
以我的经验来说 你不可能制止任何一个大屠杀
{\fs60}In my experience, you can't stop any of them.

1557
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:47,010
人们说 “如果正义之士不行动的话，邪恶就获胜了”
{\fs60}They say evil prevails when good men fail to act.

1558
01:46:47,230 --> 01:46:51,210
这句话应该是，“邪恶获胜了”
{\fs60}What they ought to say is, evil prevails.

1559
01:47:05,060 --> 01:47:07,150
我现在和被上帝遗忘的这个国家的统治者
{\fs60}I now shared even more in common...

1560
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:10,400
有了更多的相同点
{\fs60}with the leader of that country God seemed to have forsaken.

1561
01:47:10,510 --> 01:47:13,320
我们在对方里看到了一些我们并不喜欢的东西
{\fs60}We saw something in each other that neither of us liked.

1562
01:47:13,850 --> 01:47:16,300
也许我们各自只是在看一面镜子
{\fs60}Or maybe we were just looking in the mirror.

1563
01:47:36,490 --> 01:47:38,880
我给了一个利比里亚医生20美元
{\fs60}I paid a Monrovian doctor twenty dollars

1564
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:40,800
叫他把维塔利身体里的子弹都取出来
{\fs60}to remove the lead from Vitaly's body

1565
01:47:40,810 --> 01:47:42,760
然后写一个伪造的死亡证明书
{\fs60}and write a bogus death certificate.

1566
01:47:43,740 --> 01:47:45,460
我应该多给他一些
{\fs60}I should've paid more.

1567
01:47:45,660 --> 01:47:48,120
我走私里上百万的弹药
{\fs60}I've smuggled millions of rounds of ammunition,

1568
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:49,820
但是那颗把我送到监狱里的
{\fs60}and the bullet that lands me in jail...

1569
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:52,200
确是那颗在我弟弟肋骨下的子弹
{\fs60}is found under my dead brother's rib.

1570
01:47:53,970 --> 01:47:55,380
尤里·奥洛夫
{\fs60}Yuri Orlov.

1571
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:58,720
我是美国烟酒枪械管理署的
{\fs60}We're with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

1572
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,100
让我猜一猜
{\fs60}Let me guess.

1573
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:02,240
这一定不是关于烟和酒
{\fs60}This is not about the alcohol or the tobacco.

1574
01:48:44,390 --> 01:48:45,770
克里米亚餐馆
{\fs60}Crimean Restaurant.

1575
01:48:45,820 --> 01:48:46,900
爸爸？
{\fs60}Papa?

1576
01:48:54,250 --> 01:48:56,670
我两个儿子都已经死了
{\fs60}Both my sons are dead.

1577
01:48:59,890 --> 01:49:02,140
生活中有两种悲惨的事
{\fs60}There are only two tragedies in life.

1578
01:49:02,610 --> 01:49:04,610
一种是你想要的得不到
{\fs60}One is not getting what you want.

1579
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:06,390
另一种是你得到了
{\fs60}The other is getting it.

1580
01:49:06,420 --> 01:49:07,630
这是不是你的？
{\fs60}Is this one of yours?

1581
01:49:07,670 --> 01:49:10,350
杰克·范伦提终于得到了他想要的
{\fs60}Jack Valentine finally had what he wanted.

1582
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:14,880
真奇怪，死亡证明书上写他死于心脏衰竭
{\fs60}Curiously, the death certificate says he died of heart failure.

1583
01:49:16,090 --> 01:49:18,030
伪造死亡证明书？
{\fs60}Falsifying a death certificate?

1584
01:49:18,470 --> 01:49:19,780
这个罪名可告不了我
{\fs60}That's not gonna hold me.

1585
01:49:20,470 --> 01:49:24,060
你说的没错 和平时一样，你又说对了
{\fs60}You're right. As usual, you are right.

1586
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:28,270
你看今天的报纸了吗？
{\fs60}Have you seen today's paper? Huh?

1587
01:49:36,220 --> 01:49:37,950
假冒使用者证明书
{\fs60}Fake end-user certificates.

1588
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:40,320
空壳公司，虚假目录
{\fs60}Cut-out companies, meticulously catalogued.

1589
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:45,650
世界上没有一个独裁者
{\fs60}There is hardly a warlord, dictator, despot anywhere in the world

1590
01:49:45,660 --> 01:49:47,470
军阀没有和你打过交道
{\fs60}that you're a first-name basis with.

1591
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:52,740
是你的妻子帮助，让我们捉到了你
{\fs60}It was your wife your trophy wife that led us to the prize.

1592
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:54,840
那不是她的错
{\fs60}It's not her fault.

1593
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:56,480
她只是比你好跟踪罢了
{\fs60}She's just easier to follow than you are.

1594
01:49:58,770 --> 01:49:59,720
我可以看报纸吗？
{\fs60}May I?

1595
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:01,930
没问题，看吧
{\fs60}Yeah, go ahead.

1596
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:27,740
慢慢享受吧
{\fs60}Enjoy it.

1597
01:50:28,890 --> 01:50:29,460
什么？
{\fs60}What?

1598
01:50:29,790 --> 01:50:30,590
这个
{\fs60}This.

1599
01:50:31,470 --> 01:50:33,390
随你说吧
{\fs60}Tell me I'm everything you despise.

1600
01:50:33,980 --> 01:50:35,890
说我是邪恶的化身
{\fs60}That I'm the personification of evil.

1601
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:37,300
还有什么?
{\fs60}What?

1602
01:50:37,730 --> 01:50:42,000
应该对世界混乱的秩序负责
{\fs60}Responsible for the breakdown of the fabric of society and world order.

1603
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:44,430
创造大屠杀的人
{\fs60}I'm a one-man genocide.

1604
01:50:45,260 --> 01:50:47,170
你现在想说什么就说什么吧
{\fs60}Say everything you want to say to me now.

1605
01:50:48,090 --> 01:50:49,460
因为你已经没时间了
{\fs60}Because you don't have long.

1606
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:51,400
你在注意听吗?
{\fs60}Are you paying attention?

1607
01:50:52,700 --> 01:50:54,200
还是你在做梦?
{\fs60}Or are you delusional?

1608
01:50:55,230 --> 01:50:58,680
你已经违反了每一条法律
{\fs60}You have broken every arms embargo written.

1609
01:50:58,820 --> 01:51:03,200
我们有足够的证据来判你终身监禁
{\fs60}There is enough here to put you away for consecutive life sentences.

1610
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:05,160
在你真正进监狱之前
{\fs60}You are going to spend the next ten years of your life

1611
01:51:05,190 --> 01:51:07,160
你会花十年时间
{\fs60}going from a cell to a courtroom

1612
01:51:07,180 --> 01:51:09,690
在监狱和法院之间穿梭
{\fs60} before you even start serving your time.

1613
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:16,560
我想你没有真正认识到这个问题的严重性
{\fs60}I don't think you fully appreciate the seriousness of your situation.

1614
01:51:27,050 --> 01:51:29,570
我的家人不认我了
{\fs60}My family has disowned me.

1615
01:51:31,380 --> 01:51:33,840
我的妻子和孩子离开了我
{\fs60}My wife and son have left me.

1616
01:51:37,100 --> 01:51:38,490
我的弟弟死了
{\fs60}My brother's dead.

1617
01:51:39,590 --> 01:51:40,480
相信我
{\fs60}Trust me.

1618
01:51:41,140 --> 01:51:44,530
我很真正认识到这个问题的严重性
{\fs60}I fully appreciate the seriousness of my situation.

1619
01:51:44,990 --> 01:51:46,290
我敢对你发誓
{\fs60}But I promise you,

1620
01:51:47,170 --> 01:51:49,540
我不会在法院里呆上一秒钟
{\fs60}I won't spend a single second in a courtroom.

1621
01:51:51,070 --> 01:51:52,340
你是在做梦
{\fs60}You are delusional.

1622
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:54,520
我喜欢你杰克
{\fs60}I like you, Jack.

1623
01:51:55,660 --> 01:51:59,170
不，也许不是，但是我了解你
{\fs60}Well, maybe not, but I understand you.

1624
01:52:02,900 --> 01:52:04,860
让我来告诉你将会发生什么
{\fs60}Let me tell you what's gonna happen.

1625
01:52:06,150 --> 01:52:08,910
这样可以让你有所准备
{\fs60}This way, you can prepare yourself.

1626
01:52:13,070 --> 01:52:14,000
好的
{\fs60}Okay.

1627
01:52:14,420 --> 01:52:16,560
很快，会有人来敲门
{\fs60}Soon there's going to be a knock on that door

1628
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:17,820
你会被叫到外面去
{\fs60}and you will be called outside.

1629
01:52:17,910 --> 01:52:20,390
在过道里 会有一个官阶比你高的人站在那里
{\fs60}In the hall there will be a man who outranks you.

1630
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:23,370
首先，他会祝贺你所做的一切
{\fs60}First, he'll compliment you on the fine job you've done

1631
01:52:23,630 --> 01:52:25,880
你使世界成为一个和平的地方
